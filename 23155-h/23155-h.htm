<div class="blockquot">
<p>Attempts to delineate local character are always
liable to misconstruction; for, the more truthful the
sketch, the greater is the number of persons, to whom
resemblance may be discovered; and thus, while in
fact only describing the characteristics of a class,
authors are frequently subjected, very unjustly, to
the imputation of having invaded the privacy of individuals.
Particularly is this so, when the class
is idealized, and an imaginary type is taken, as the
representative of the species.</p>

<p>I deem it proper, therefore, to say in advance,
that no attempt has been made in the following
pages, to portray any individual; and that&mdash;although
I hope I have not been so unsuccessful, as
to paint pictures which have no originals&mdash;if there
be a portrait in any sketch, it consists, not in the
likeness of the picture to the person, but of both to
the type.</p>

<p>As originally projected, the book would have
borne this explanation upon its face; but the circumstances
which have reduced its dimensions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
changed its plan, have also rendered necessary a
disclaimer, which would, otherwise, have been superfluous.</p>
<br />

<p>One or two of the sketches might have been made
more complete had I been fortunate enough to meet
with certain late publications, in time to use them.
Such is the elaborate work of Mr. Schoolcraft upon
Indian History and Character; and such, also, is
that of Mr. Shea, upon the voyages and labors of
Marquette&mdash;a book whose careful accuracy, clear
style, and lucid statement, might have been of much
service in writing the sketch entitled &ldquo;<i>The Voyageur</i>.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, however, I saw neither of
these admirable publications, until my work had assumed
its present shape&mdash;a fact which I regret as
much for my reader's sake as my own.</p>

<p>The valley of a river like the channel of a
man's career, does not always bear proportion
to the magnitude or volume of the current,
which flows through it. Mountains, forests,
deserts, physical barriers to the former&mdash;and
the obstacles of prejudice, and accidents of
birth and education, moral barriers to the latter&mdash;limit,
modify, and impair the usefulness
of each. A river thus confined, an intellect
thus hampered, may be noisy, fretful, turbulent,
but, in the contemplation, there is ever a
feeling of the incongruity between the purpose
and the power; and it is only when the valley
is extended, the field of effort open, that we
can avoid the impression of energy wasted, and
strength frittered away. The great intellect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
whose scope is not confined by ancient landmarks,
or old prejudices, is thus typified by the
broad, deep river, whose branches penetrate the
Earth on every hand, and add to the current
the tributaries of all climes. In this view, how
noble an object is the Mississippi!</p>

<p>In extent, fertility, variety of scenery, and
diversity of climate, its valley surpasses any
other in the world. It is the great aorta of
the continent, and receives a score of tributary
rivers, the least of which is larger than the
vaunted streams of mighty empires. It might
furnish natural boundaries to all Europe, and
yet leave, for every country, a river greater than
the Seine. It discharges, in one year, more
water than has issued from the Tiber in five
centuries; it swallows up near fifty nameless
rivers longer than the Thames; the addition
of the waters of the Danube would not swell it
half a fathom; and in a single bend, the navies
of the world might safely ride at anchor, five
hundred miles from sea.</p>

<p>It washes the shores of twelve powerful states,
and between its arms lies space enough for twenty
more. The rains which fall upon the Alleghenies,
and the snows that shroud the slopes and
cap the summits of the Rocky mountains, are
borne upon its bosom, to the regions of perpet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>ual
summer, and poured into the sea, more than
fifteen hundred leagues from their sources. It
has formed a larger tract of land, by the deposits
of its inundations, than is contained in
Great Britain and Ireland; and every year it
roots up and bears away more trees, than there
are in the Black Forest. At a speed unknown
to any other great river, it rolls a volume, in
whose depths the cathedral of St. Paul's might
be sunk out of sight; and five hundred leagues
from its mouth, it is wider than at thirty.</p>

<p>It annually bears away more acres than it
would require to make a German principality,
engulfing more than the revenues of many a
petty kingdom. Beneath its turbid waters lie
argosies of wealth, and floating palaces, among
whose gilded halls and rich saloons are sporting
slimy creatures; below your very feet, as you
sail along its current, are resting in its bed,
half buried in the sand, the bodies of bold men
and tender maidens; and their imploring hands
are raised toward Heaven, and the world which
floats, unheeding, on the surface. There lies,
entombed, the son whose mother knows not of
his death; and there the husband, for whose
footstep, even yet, the wife is listening&mdash;here,
the mother with her infant still clasped fondly
to her breast; and here, united in their lives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
not separated in their death, lie, side by side,
the bride and bridegroom of a day;&mdash;and,
hiding the dread secrets from all human ken,
the mighty and remorseless river passes onward,
like the stream of human life, toward
&ldquo;the land of dreams and shadows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the contemplative mind, there is, perhaps,
no part of the creation, in which may not be
found the seed of much reflection; but of all
the grand features of the earth's surface, next to
a lofty mountain, that which impresses us most
deeply is a great river. Its pauseless flow, the
stern momentum of its current&mdash;its remorseless
coldness to all human hopes and fears&mdash;the secrets
which lie buried underneath its waters,
and the myriad purposes of those it bears upon
its bosom&mdash;are all so clearly typical of Time.
The waters will not pause, though dreadful battles
may be fought upon their shores&mdash;as Time
will steadily march forward, though the fate
of nations hang upon the conflict. The moments
fly as swiftly, while a mighty king is
breathing out his life, as if he were a lowly
peasant; and the current flows as coldly on,
while men are struggling in the eddies, as if
each drowning wretch were but a floating weed.
Time gives no warning of the hidden dangers
on which haughty conquerors are rushing, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the perils of the waters are revealed but in the
crashing of the wreck.</p>

<p>But the parallel does not stop here. The
sources of the Mississippi&mdash;were it even possible
that they should ever be otherwise&mdash;are
still unknown to man. Like the stream of history,
its head-springs are in the regions of fable&mdash;in
the twilight of remote latitudes; and it is
only after it has approached us, and assumed a
definite channel, that we are able to determine
which is the authentic stream. It flows from
the country of the savage, toward that of civilization;
and like the gradations of improvement
among men, are the thickening fields and
growing cultivation, which define the periods
of its course. Near its mouth, it has reached
the culmination of refinement&mdash;its last ripe
fruit, a crowded city; and, beyond this, there
lies nothing but a brief journey, and a plunge
into the gulf of Eternity!</p>

<p>Thus, an emblem of the stream of history, it
is still more like a march along the highway
of a single human life. As the sinless thoughts
of smiling childhood are the little rivulets,
which afterward become the mighty river;
like the infant, airy, volatile, and beautiful&mdash;sparkling
as the dimpled face of innocence&mdash;a
faithful reflex of the lights and shadows of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
existence; and revealing, through the limpid
wave, the golden sands which lie beneath.
Anon, the errant channels are united in one
current&mdash;life assumes a purpose, a direction&mdash;but
the waters are yet pure, and mirror on their
face the thousand forms and flashing colors of
Creation's beauty&mdash;as happy boyhood, rapidly
perceptive of all loveliness, gives forth, in radiant
smiles, the glad impressions of unfaded
youth.</p>

<p>Yet sorrow cometh even to the happiest.
Misfortune is as stern a leveller as Death; and
early youth, with all its noble aspirations, gorgeous
visions, never to be realized, must often
plunge, like the placid river over a foaming
cataract, down the precipice of affliction&mdash;even
while its current, though nearing the abyss,
flow softly as &ldquo;the waters of Shiloah.&rdquo; It may
be the death of a mother, whom the bereaved
half deemed immortal&mdash;some disappointment,
like the falsehood of one dearly loved&mdash;some
rude shock, as the discovery of a day-dream's
hollowness; happy, thrice happy! if it be but
one of these, and not the descent from innocence
to sin!</p>

<p>But life rolls on, as does the river, though its
wave no longer flows in placid beauty, nor reveals
the hidden things beneath. The ripples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
are now whirling eddies, and a hundred angry
currents chafe along the rocks, as thought and
feeling fret against the world, and waste their
strength in vain repining or impatient irritation.
Tranquillity returns no more; and
though the waters seem not turbid, there is
a shadow in their depths&mdash;their transparency
is lost.</p>

<p>Tributaries, great and small, flow in&mdash;accessions
of experience to the man, of weight and
volume to the river; and, with force augmented,
each rolls on its current toward the ocean.
A character, a purpose, is imparted to the life,
as to the stream, and usefulness becomes an
element of being. The river is a chain which
links remotest latitudes, as through the social
man relations are established, binding alien
hearts: the spark of thought and feeling, like
the fluid of the magnet, brings together distant
moral zones.</p>

<p>On it rushes&mdash;through the rapids, where the
life receives an impulse&mdash;driven forward&mdash;haply
downward&mdash;among rocks and dangerous
channels, by the motives of ambition, by
the fierce desire of wealth, or by the goad of
want! But soon the mad career abates, for
the first effect of haste is agitation, and the
master-spell of power is calmness. Happy are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
they, who learn this lesson early&mdash;for, thence,
the current onward flows, a tranquil, noiseless,
but resistless, tide. Manhood, steady and mature,
with its resolute but quiet thoughts, its
deep, unwavering purposes, and, more than all,
its firm, profound affections, is passing thus, between
the shores of Time&mdash;not only working
for itself a channel broad and clear, but bearing
on its bosom, toward Eternity, uncounted
wealth of hopes.</p>

<p>But in the middle of its course, its character
is wholly changed; a flood pours in, whose
waters hold, suspended, all impurities. A
struggle, brief but turbulent, ensues: the limpid
wave of youth is swallowed up. Some
great success has been achieved; unholy passions
are evoked, and will not be allayed;
thenceforward there is no relenting; and,
though the world&mdash;nay! Heaven itself!&mdash;pour
in, along its course, broad tributaries of
reclaiming purity, the cloud upon the waters
can never be dispelled. The marl and dross
of Earth, impalpable, but visibly corrupting,
pervade the very nature; and only when the
current ceases, will its primitive transparency
return.</p>

<p>Still it hurries onward, with velocity augmented,
as it nears its term. Yet its breadth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
is not increased; the earth suspended in its
waters, like the turbid passions of the human
soul, prevents expansion;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for, in man's career
through time, the heart grows wider only in
the pure.</p>

<p>Along the base of cliffs and highlands&mdash;through
the deep alluvions of countless ages&mdash;among
stately forests and across extended plains,
it flows without cessation. Beyond full manhood,
character may change no more&mdash;as, below
its mighty tributaries, the river is unaltered.
Its full development is reached among rich plantations,
waving fields, and swarming cities;
while, but the journey of a day beyond, it
rushes into Eternity, leaving a melancholy record,
as it mingles with the waters of the great
gulf, even upon the face of Oblivion.</p>

<p>&mdash;Within the valley of this river, time will see
a population of two hundred millions; and here
will be the seat of the most colossal power
Earth has yet contained. The heterogeneous
character of the people is of no consequence:
still less, the storms of dissension, which now
and then arise, to affright the timid and faithless.
The waters of all latitudes could not be
blended in one element, and purified, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the tempests and cross-currents, which lash the
ocean into fury. Nor would a stagnant calmness,
blind attachment to the limited horizon
of a homestead, or the absence of all irritation
or attrition, ever make one people of the emigrants
from every clime.</p>

<p>And, when this nation shall have become
thoroughly homogeneous&mdash;when the world
shall recognise <i>the race</i>, and, above this, <i>the
power</i> of the race&mdash;will there be no interest in
tracing through the mists of many generations,
the outlines of that foundation on which is
built the mighty fabric? Even the infirmities
and vices of the men who piled the first stones
of great empires, are chronicled in history as
facts deserving record. The portrait of an ancient
hero is a treasure beyond value, even
though the features be but conjectural. How
much more precious would be a faithful portrait
of <i>his character</i>, in which the features
should be his salient traits&mdash;the expression,
outline, and complexion of his nature!</p>

<br />
<p>To furnish a series of such portraits&mdash;embracing
a few of the earlier characters, whose
&ldquo;mark&rdquo; is traceable in the growing civilization
of the West and South&mdash;is the design of the
present work. The reader will observe that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
logic is not the selection of actual, but of ideal,
individuals, each representing a class; and that,
although it is arranged chronologically, the periods
are not historical, but characteristic. The
design, then, is double; <i>first</i>, to select a <i>class</i>,
which indicates a certain stage of social or political
advancement; and, <i>second</i>, to present a
picture of an imaginary individual, who combines
the prominent traits, belonging to the
class thus chosen.</p>

<p>The series halts, beyond the Rubicon of contemporaneous
portraiture, for very obvious reasons;
but there are still in existence abundant
means of verifying, or correcting, every sketch.
I have endeavored to give the consciousness of
this fact its full weight&mdash;to resist the temptation
(which, I must admit, was sometimes
strong) to touch the borders of satire; and, in
conclusion, I can only hope that these wishes,
with an earnest effort at fidelity, have enabled
me to present truthful pictures.</p>

<p>In a work which professes to trace, even indistinctly,
the reclamation of a country from a
state of barbarism, some notice of that from
which it was reclaimed is, of course, necessary;
and an attempt to distinguish the successive
periods, each by its representative character,
determines the logic of such notice. Were we
as well acquainted with the gradations of Indian
advancement&mdash;for such unquestionably,
there were&mdash;as we are with those of the civilized
man, we should be able to distinguish eras
and periods, so as to represent them, each by
its separate <i>ideal</i>. But civilization and barbarism
are comparative terms; and, though it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
difficult, perhaps impossible, precisely to fix the
point at which one ceases and the other begins,
yet, within that limit, we must consider barbarism
as <i>one</i> period. Of this period, in our plan,
the Indian, without reference to distinction of
tribe, or variation in degree of advancement, is
the representative. As all triangles agree in
certain properties, though widely different in
others, so all Indians are alike in certain characteristics,
though differing, almost radically, each
from every other: But, as the points of coincidence
in triangles are those which determine
the class, and the differences only indicate subspecies,
so the similar characteristics in the
Indian, are those which distinguish the species,
and the variations of character are, at most,
only tribal limits. An Indian who should combine
all the equivalent traits, without any of
the inequalities, would, therefore, be the pure
ideal of his race. And his composition should
include the evil as well as the good; for a portrait
of the savage, which should represent him
as only generous and brave, would be as far
from a complete ideal, as one which should
display only his cruelty and cunning.</p>

<p>My object in this article is, therefore, to combine
as many as possible&mdash;or as many as are
necessary&mdash;of the general characteristics of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Indian, both good and bad&mdash;so as to give a
fair view of the character, according to the
principle intimated above. And I may, perhaps
without impropriety, here state, that this
may be taken as the key to all the sketches
which are to follow. It is quite probable that
many examples of each class treated, might
be found, who are exceptions to the rules
stated, in almost every particular; and it is
possible, that no <i>one</i>, of <i>any</i> class treated, combined
<i>all</i> the characteristics elaborated. Excepting
when historical facts are related, or well-authenticated
legends worked in, my object is
not to give portraits of individuals, however
prominent. As was hinted above&mdash;the logic
of the book points only to the ideal of each
class.</p>

<br />
<p>And this view of the subject excludes all
those discussions, which have so long puzzled
philosophers, about the origin of the race&mdash;our
business is with the question <i>What is he?</i> rather
than with the inquiry, <i>Whence did he come?</i>
The shortest argument, however&mdash;and, if the
assumption be admitted, the most conclusive&mdash;is
that, which assumes the literal truth of the
Mosaic account of the creation of man; for
from this it directly follows, that the aboriginal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
races are descendants of Asiatic emigrants; and
the minor questions, as to the route they followed&mdash;whether
across the Pacific, or by Behring's
strait&mdash;are merely subjects of curious
speculation, or still more curious research. And
this hypothesis is quite consistent with the evidence
drawn from Indian languages, customs,
and physical developments. Even the arguments
against the theory, drawn from differences
in these particulars among the tribes,
lose their force, when we come to consider that
the same, if not wider differences, are found
among other races, indisputably of a single
stock. These things may be satisfactorily accounted
for, by the same circumstances in the
one case, as in the other&mdash;by political and
local situation, by climate, and unequal progress.
Thus, the Indian languages, says Prescott,
in his &ldquo;Conquest of Mexico,&rdquo; &ldquo;present
the strange anomaly of differing as widely in
etymology, as they agree in organization;&rdquo; but
a key to the solution of the problem, is found
in the latter part of the same sentence: &ldquo;and,
on the other hand,&rdquo; he continues,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &ldquo;while they
bear some slight affinity to the languages of
the Old World, in the former particular, they
have no resemblance to them whatever, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
latter.&rdquo; This is as much as if he had said, that
the incidents to the lives of American Indians,
are totally different to those of the nations of
the Old World: and these incidents are precisely
the circumstances, which are likely to
affect organization, more than etymology. And
the difficulty growing out of their differences
among themselves, in the latter, is surmounted
by the fact, that there is a sufficient general resemblance
among them all, to found a comparison
with &ldquo;the languages of the Old World.&rdquo;
I believe, a parallel course of argument would
clear away all other objections to the theory.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<br />
<p>But, as has been said, the scope of our work
includes none of these discussions; and we
shall, therefore, pass to the Indian character,
abstracted from all antecedents. That this has
been, and is, much misunderstood, is the first
thought which occurs to one who has an oppor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>tunity
personally to observe the savage. Nor is
it justly a matter of surprise. The native of this
continent has been the subject of curious and
unsatisfactory speculation, since the discovery
of the country by Columbus: by the very <i>want</i>
of those things, which constitute the attraction
of other nations, he became at once, and has
continued, the object of a mysterious interest.
The absence of dates and facts, to mark the
course of his migration, remits us to conjecture,
or the scarcely more reliable resource of tradition&mdash;the
want of history has made him a
character of romance. The mere name of Indian
gives the impression of a shadowy image,
looming, dim but gigantic, through a darkness
which nothing else can penetrate. This mystery
not only interests, but also disarms, the
mind; and we are apt to see, in the character,
around which it hovers, only those qualities
which give depth to the attraction. The creations
of poetry and romance are usually extremes;
and they are, perhaps, necessarily so,
when the nature of the subject furnishes no
standard, by which to temper the conception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The efforts of a poet's imagination are, more
or less, under the control of his opinions:&rdquo; but
opinions of men are founded upon their history;
and there is, properly, <i>no</i> historical Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
character. The consequence has been, that
poets and novelists have constructed their savage
personages according to a hypothetical
standard, of either the virtues or vices, belonging,
potentially, to the savage state. The same
rule, applied to portraiture of civilized men,
would at once be declared false and pernicious;
and the only reason why it is not equally
so, in its application to the Indian, is, because
the separation between him and us is so broad,
that our conceptions of his character can exert
little or no influence upon our intercourse with
mankind.</p>

<p>Sympathy for what are called the Indian's
misfortunes, has, also, induced the class of writers,
from whom, almost exclusively, our notions
of his character are derived, to represent him
in his most genial phases, and even to palliate
his most ferocious acts, by reference to the injustice
and oppression, of which he has been
the victim. If we were to receive the authority
of these writers, we should conclude that
the native was not a savage, at all, until the
landing of the whites; and, instead of ascribing
his atrocities to the state of barbarism in which
he lived&mdash;thus indicating their only valid
apology&mdash;we should degrade both the white
and the red men, by attributing to the former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
all imaginable vices, and, to the latter, a peculiar
aptitude in acquiring them. These mistakes
are natural and excusable&mdash;as the man
who kills another in self-defence is justifiable;
but the Indian character is not the less misconceived,
just as the man slain is not less dead,
than if malice had existed in both cases. To
praise one above his merits, is as fatal to his
consideration, as decidedly to disparage him.
In either case, however, there is a chance that
a just opinion may be formed; but, when both
extremes are asserted with equal confidence,
the mind is confused, and can settle upon nothing.
The latter is precisely the condition of
the Indian; and it is with a view of correcting
such impressions, that this article is written.</p>

<br />
<p>The American Indian, then, is the ideal of a
savage&mdash;no more, no less: and I call him the
ideal, because he displays <i>all</i> those qualities,
which the history of the human race authorizes
us to infer, as the characteristics of an unenlightened
people, for many ages isolated from
the rest of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He differs, in many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
particulars, from the other barbarians of the
world; but the broadest distinction lies in this
<i>completeness</i> of his savage character. The peculiarities
of the country in which their lives
assume their direction, its climate, isolation; or
connection with the world&mdash;all these things contribute
to modify the aspects presented by native
races. In such points as are liable to modification
by these causes, the American differs from
every other savage; and without entering into
an elaborate comparison of circumstances&mdash;for
which we have neither the material, the inclination,
nor the space&mdash;it may be proper briefly
to consider <i>one</i> of these causes, and endeavor
to trace its effects in the Indian's moral physiognomy.</p>

<br />
<p>The state of this continent, when the first
Asiatic wanderers landed upon its shores, was,
of course, that of a vast, unbroken solitude;
and the contemplation of its almost boundless
extent and profound loneliness, was certainly
the first, and probably the most powerful agency,
at work in modifying their original character.
What the primary effects of this cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
were likely to be, we may observe in the white
emigrants, who have sought a home among the
forests and upon the plains of the west: whatever
they may have been before their migration,
they soon become meditative, abstracted,
and taciturn. These, and especially the last,
are the peculiar characteristics of the Indian;
his taciturnity, indeed, amounts to austerity,
sometimes impressing the observer with the
idea of affectation. The dispersion, which must
have been the effect of unlimited choice in
lands&mdash;the mode of life pursued by those who
depended upon the chase for subsistence&mdash;the
gradual estrangement produced among the separate
tribes, by the necessity of wide hunting-grounds&mdash;the
vast expanse of territory at command&mdash;causes
operating so long, as to produce
a fixed and corresponding nature&mdash;are the
sources, to which we may trace almost all the
Indian's distinctive traits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isolation,&rdquo; Carlyle says, &ldquo;is the sum total
of wretchedness to man;&rdquo; and, doubtless, the
idea which he means to convey is just. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
in the words of De Quincey, &ldquo;no man can be
truly <i>great</i>, without at least chequering his life
with solitude.&rdquo; Separation from his kind, of
course, deprives a man of the humanizing influences,
which are the consequences of associa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>tion;
but it may, at the same time, strengthen
some of the noblest qualities of human nature.
Thus, we are authorized to ascribe to this agency,
a portion of the Indian's fortitude under
hardships and suffering, his contempt for mere
meanness, and above all, the proud elevation
of his character. The standards of comparison,
which were furnished by his experience, were
few, and, of course, derived from the ideas of
barbarians; but all such as were in any way
modified by the solitude of his existence, were
rendered impressive, solemn, and exalted.</p>

<p>In the vast solitudes of Asia, whence the Indian
races migrated to this continent, so far as
the loneliness of savage deserts and endless
plains might exert an influence, we should expect
to find the same general character. But
the Asians are almost universally pastoral&mdash;the
Americans never; the wildest tribes of
Tartary possess numerous useful domesticated
animals&mdash;the Americans, even in Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
had none; the Tartars are acquainted with the
use of milk, and have been so from time immemorial&mdash;the
Indian, even at this day, has
adopted it only in a few localities, among the
more enlightened tribes. The migration of the
latter either took place at a period before even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his Asiatic father had discovered its use, or the
accidents which brought him to this continent,
were such as to preclude importing domesticated
animals; and the lapse of a few generations
was sufficient to obliterate even the
recollection of such knowledge. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says
Prescott,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> &ldquo;he might well doubt, whether the
wild, uncouth monsters, whom he occasionally
saw bounding with such fury over the distant
plains, were capable of domestication, like the
meek animals which he had left grazing in the
green pastures of Asia.&rdquo; To this leading distinction&mdash;the
adoption and neglect of pastoral
habits&mdash;may be referred most of the diversities
among races, unquestionably of one stock.</p>

<br />
<p>Reasoning from the effects upon human character,
produced by the face of different countries,
we might expect to find, in the Indian,
among other things, a strong tendency toward
poetical thought, embodied, not in the mode of
expression usually denominated poetry, but in
the style of his addresses, the peculiarities of his
theories, or the construction of his mythology,
language, and laws. This expectation is totally
disappointed; but when we examine the
<i>degree</i> and <i>character</i> of his advancement, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
recollect a few of the circumstances, among
which the poetry looked for would be obliged
to grow, our disappointment loses its element
of surprise. The contemplation of Nature in
her primitive, terrible, and beautiful forms&mdash;the
habit of meditation, almost the necessary
consequence of solitude&mdash;the strange, wild
enchantment of an adventurous life&mdash;have
failed to develop in the Indian, any but selfish
and sensual ideas. Written poetry was, of
course, not to be expected, even from the indigenous
civilization of Mexico and Peru; yet
we might, with some ground for hope, seek
occasional traces of poetical thought and feeling.
We look in vain for any such thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extremes meet,&rdquo; says one of the wisest of
adages; and the saying was never more singularly
and profoundly vindicated, than in its
application to civilization and barbarism. The
savage rejects all that does not directly gratify
his selfish wants&mdash;the highly-civilized man is,
in like manner, governed by the principle of
<i>utility</i>; and, by both, the merely fanciful and
imaginative is undervalued. Thus, as Mr.
Macaulay<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ingeniously says, &ldquo;A great poem,
in a highly-polished state of society, is the
most wonderful and splendid proof of genius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>.&rdquo;
But, for the same reasons, the savage, who
should display any remarkably poetical feeling
or tone of thought, would be quite as great a
prodigy. Poetry flourishes most luxuriantly
midway between the two extremes. Its essence
is the contemplation of great passions and actions&mdash;of
love, revenge, ambition. Imagination
is then vivified by the means of expression
or articulation; and, in the half-civilized state,
neither a refined public sentiment, nor the
other extreme of barbarous isolation, restrains
the exhibition of great (and poetical) emotions.</p>

<p>The best of Hazlitt's numerous definitions
of poetry, determines it to be &ldquo;the excess of
imagination, beyond the actual or ordinary impression
of any object or feeling.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But the
Indian was destitute of all imagination; apparently,
the composition of his nature included
no such element; and, certainly, the rude exigencies
of his life did not admit its action.
Even the purity of his mythology, compared to
that of the Greeks and Romans,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> has been (by
Lord Lindsay) attributed to this want&mdash;though,
if such were its only effects, it might very well
be supplied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian has no humor, no romance&mdash;how
could he possess poetical feeling? The
gratification of sensual wants is the end of his
life&mdash;too often, <i>literally</i> the end! &ldquo;He considers
everything beneath his notice, which is
not necessary to his advantage or enjoyment.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
To him a jest is as unmeaning as the babbling of
a brook; his wife is a beast of burden; and even
his courting is carried on by gifts of good things
<i>to eat</i>, sent to the parents.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Heaven is merely a
hunting-ground; his language has no words to
express abstract qualities, virtues, vices, or sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
His idea of the Great Spirit, and the
word which expresses it, may be applied with
equal propriety to a formidable (though not
beneficent) <i>animal</i>; indeed, the Indian words
which we translate &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; mean only superior
power, without the qualification of good or
evil. He has not even the ordinary inhabitive
instinct of the human race; his attachment to
any region of country depends upon its capacity
to furnish game, and the fading of the former
keeps pace with the disappearance of the latter.
&ldquo;Attachment to the graves of his fathers,&rdquo; is an
agreeable fiction&mdash;unfortunately, only a fic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>tion.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
He has always been nomadic, without
the pastoral habits which the word supposes:
a mere wandering savage, without purpose or
motive, beyond the gratification of the temporary
want, whim, or passion, and void of <i>everything</i>
deserving the name of sentiment.</p>

<br />
<p>An extravagant, and, I am sorry to say, groundless,
notion has obtained currency, among almost
all writers upon the Indian character, that
he is distinguished for his <i>eloquence</i>. But the
same authors tell us, that his language, the vehicle
of the supposed eloquence, can express only
material ideas.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now, if we knew no more
of his character than this, we should be authorized
to infer (what is, indeed, true), that he possesses
no standard for the distinction of good
and evil, and that his imagination is bounded
by the lines of his sensible experience. How
any degree of eloquence can be compatible
with this state of things, passes comprehension.
And what reflection would conclude, a little
examination will confirm. The mistake has,
doubtless, grown out of a misconception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
nature of eloquence itself.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If eloquence were
all <i>figure</i>&mdash;even if it were, in any considerable
degree, <i>mere</i> figure&mdash;then the tawdriest rhetorician
would be the greatest orator. But it is
not so. On the contrary, the use of many
words (or figures) to express an idea, denotes
not command of language, but the absence of
that power&mdash;just as the employment of numerous
tools, to effect a physical object, indicates,
not skill in the branch of physics, to which the
object belongs, but rather awkwardness. Of
course, much must be placed, in both cases, to
the account of clumsy instruments; but the
instrument of speech differs from others in this:
it is fashioned <i>by</i>, as well as <i>for</i>, its use; and a
rude, unpolished language is, therefore, an index,
in two ways, of the want of eloquence
among the people who employ it.</p>

<p>In this view, the figurative elocution of the Indian,
so far from affording evidence of oratorical
power, if it proves anything, proves the opposite.
It is the barrenness of his language,
and not the luxuriance of his imagination,
which enforces that mode of speech.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Imagi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>nation
is the first element of oratory, simplicity
its first condition. We have seen that the Indian
is wholly destitute of the former; and the
stilted, meretricious, and ornate style, of even
his ordinary communications, entirely excludes
the latter from our conception of his character.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>For example: take the expressions &ldquo;bury
the hatchet,&rdquo; for &ldquo;make peace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a cloudless
sky,&rdquo; for &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo;&mdash;the latter being
the nearest approximation to an abstract idea
observed in Indian oratory. Upon examining
these, and kindred forms of speech, we shall at
once perceive that they are not the result of
imagination, but are suggested by <i>material</i>
analogies. Peace, to the savage, is, at best,
but a negative idea; and the <i>state</i> of peacefulness,
abstracted from the absence of war, finds
no corresponding word in his language. Even
friendship only means that relation, in which
friends may be of <i>use</i> to each other. As his
dialects are all synthetic,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> his ideas are all con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>crete.
To say, &ldquo;<i>I love</i>&rdquo; without expressing
<i>what</i> or <i>whom</i> I love, would be, so to speak,
very bad Indian grammar. He can not even
say &ldquo;two&rdquo; correctly, without applying the numeral
to some object. The notion of absolute
being, number, emotion, feeling, posture, or relation,
is utterly foreign to his mode of thought
and speech.</p>

<p>So, also, of the &ldquo;cloudless sky,&rdquo; used to express
a state of prosperity. He does not mean,
by the phrase, the serenity of mind which prosperity
produces, nor any other abstract inflexion
or suggestion of the figure. He is constantly exposed
to the storms of heaven, in the chase, and
on the war path; and, even in his best &ldquo;lodge,&rdquo;
he finds but little shelter from their fury. Clear
weather is, therefore, grateful to him&mdash;bright
sunshine associates itself, in his mind, with comfort,
or (that supremest of Indian pleasures)
undisturbed indolence. And the transition,
though, as we have said, an approach to an
abstract conception, is easy, even to the mind
of a savage. His employment of such illustrations
is rather an evidence of rudeness, than of
eloquence&mdash;of barrenness, than of luxuriance
of idea.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>From these considerations, it results, that
even the very best specimens of Indian oratory,
deserve the name of <i>picturesque</i>, rather
than of <i>eloquent</i>&mdash;two characteristics which
bear no greater affinity to each other, than do
the picture-writing of the Aztec and the alphabetical
system of the Greek. The speech of
Logan&mdash;the most celebrated of Indian harangues&mdash;even
if genuine,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is but a feeble support
to the theory of savage eloquence. It is
a mixture of the lament and the song of triumph,
which may be found in equal perfection
among all barbarous people; but, so far as we
are aware, was never elsewhere dignified with
that sounding name. The slander of a brave
and honorable man,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which it contains, might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
be the result of a mistake easily made; the
wrongs of which this chief was the victim,
might render even a savage eloquent; and the
mixture of bloody vaunting with profound
grief, is scarcely to be expected in any <i>but</i> a
savage. &ldquo;Logan never knew fear,&rdquo; he says;
&ldquo;he would not turn on his heel to save his
life.&rdquo; This species of boasting is perfectly in
keeping with the Indian character; but the
pathetic reason for this carelessness, which
follows&mdash;&ldquo;There is no one to mourn for Logan&rdquo;&mdash;is
one not likely to have occurred to an
Indian, even in his circumstances. And, granting
that the expression <i>was</i> used by the orator,
and not (as it seems probable it was) added by
Jefferson, it is, I believe, the only example on
record of poetical feeling in any Indian speech.</p>

<br />
<p>The <i>religion</i> of the Indian has given as much
troublesome material to the builders of systems,
as has been furnished by all his other
characteristics combined. The first explorers
of America supposed that they had found a
people, quite destitute of any religious belief.
But faith in a higher power than that of man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
is a necessity of the human mind; and its organization,
more or less enlightened, is as natural,
even to the most degraded savage, as the
formation of his language. Both depend upon
general laws, common to the intellect of all
races of men; both are affected by the external
circumstances of climate, situation, and mode
of life; and the state of one may always be determined
by that of the other. &ldquo;No savage
horde has been caught with its language in a
state of chaos, or as if just emerging from the
rudeness of indistinguishable sounds. Each
appears, not as a slow formation by painful processes
of invention, but as a perfect whole,
springing directly from the powers of man.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
And though this rigor of expression is not
equally applicable to the Indian's religion, the
fact is attributable solely to the difference in
nature of the subjects. As the &ldquo;primary sounds
of a language are essentially the same everywhere,&rdquo;
the impulses and instincts of piety are
common to all minds. But, as the written language
of the Indian was but the pictorial representation
of visible objects, having no metaphysical
signification, so the symbols of his religion,
the objects of his adoration, were drawn from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
external nature.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Even his faith in the Great
Spirit is a graft upon his system, derived from
the first missionaries;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and, eagerly as he adopted
it, it is probable that its meaning, to him, is little
more exalted, than that of the &ldquo;Great Beaver,&rdquo;
which he believes to be the first progenitor,
if not the actual creator, of that useful animal.</p>

<p>We often see the fact, that the Indian believes
in his <i>manitou</i>, cited as an evidence,
that he has the conception of a spiritual divinity.
But the word never conveyed such a
meaning; it is applicable more properly to material
objects, and answers, with, if possible, a
more intense and superstitious significance, to
the term <i>amulet</i>. The Indian's <i>manitou</i> might
be, indeed always was, some wild animal, or
some part of a beast or bird&mdash;such as a bear's
claw, a buffalo's hoof, or a dog's tooth.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And,
though he ascribed exalted powers to this primitive
guardian, it must be remembered that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
these powers were only physical&mdash;such, for example,
as would enable it to protect its devotee
from the knife of his enemy, or give him success
in hunting.</p>

<br />
<p>Materialism, then, reigns in the religion, as
in the language, of the Indian; and its effects
are what might be expected. His whole system
is a degraded and degrading superstition; and,
though it has been praised for its superior
purity, over that of the ancients, it seems to
have been forgotten, that this purity is only the
absence of <i>one kind</i> of <i>im</i>purity: and that its
cruel and corrupting influences, of another sort,
are ten-fold greater than those of the Greek
mythology. The faith of the Greek embodied
itself in forms, ceremonies, and observances&mdash;regularly
appointed religious rites kept his piety
alive; the erection of grand temples, in honor
of his deity, whatever might be his conception
of that deity's character, attested his genuine
devotion, and held constantly before his mind
the abstract idea of a higher power. The Indian,
before the coming of the white man, erected
no temples<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in honor of his divinities; for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
venerated them only so long as they conferred
physical benefits<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> upon him; and his idea of
beneficence was wholly concrete. He had no
established form of worship; the ceremonies,
which partook of a religious character, were
grotesque in their conception, variable in their
conduct, and inhuman in their details. Such,
for example, are the torturing of prisoners, and
the ceremonies observed on the occasion of a
young Indian's placing himself under his guardian
power.</p>

<br />
<p>The dogmas of the Indian religion, until varied
by the teaching of missionaries, were few
and simple&mdash;being circumscribed, like everything
else belonging to him, by the material
world. He believed in a good spirit, and an
evil spirit; but his conception was limited by
the ideas of benefit or injury, <i>to himself</i>; indeed,
it may safely be doubted, whether the
word &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; in its legitimate sense, is at all
applicable to his belief. &ldquo;Power in a state of
exertion,&rdquo; is the more accurate description of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his imperfect notion: abstract existence he
never conceived; the verb &ldquo;<i>to be</i>&rdquo; except as
relating to time, place, and action, had no
meaning in his language.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He believed, also,
in subordinate powers of good and evil; but,
since his life was occupied more in averting
danger and calamity, than in seeking safety
or happiness, he paid far more respect to the
latter than to the former&mdash;he prayed oftener
and more fervently to the devils, than to the
angels. His clearest notion of divinity, was
that of a being able to injure him; and, in this
sense, his devotion might be given to man,
bird, or beast.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt, that he believed
in a sort of immortality, even before the missionaries
visited his country. But it was not so
much a new state of existence, as a continuation
of present life.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He killed horses upon the
grave of the departed warrior, that he might
be mounted for his long journey; and buffalo
meat and roasted maize were buried with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that he might not suffer from hunger.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> On
arriving in the land of the blest, he believed,
that the dead pursued the game of that country,
as he had done in this; and the highest felicity
of which he conceived, was the liberty to hunt
unmolested by the war-parties of his enemies.
Heaven was, therefore, in his conception, only
a more genial earth, and its inheritors but keener
sportsmen.</p>

<p>That this idea of immortality involved that
of accountability, in some form, seems to admit
of no doubt; but this doctrine, like almost all
others belonging to the primitive savage, has
been moulded to its present definite shape, by
the long-continued labors of Christian missionaries.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
He believed, indeed, that the bad Indians
never reached the happy hunting-grounds,
but the distinction between the good and the
bad, in his mind, was not at all clear; and,
since the idea of the passage across the gulf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
death most prevalent among all tribes, is that
of a narrow bridge, over which only steady
nerves and sure feet may carry the wanderer,
it seems probable that the line was drawn between
the brave warrior and the successful hunter,
on the one hand, and the coward and the
unskilful, on the other. If these views be correct,
the inferences to be drawn from the Indian's
belief in immortality and accountability,
are of but slender significance.</p>

<br />
<p>Corrupt manners and degrading customs never
exist, in conjunction with a pure religious
system. The outlines of social institutions are
metaphysically coincident with the limits of
piety; and the refinement of morals depends
upon the purity of faith. We may thus determine
the prevailing spirit of a national religion,
by observation of domestic manners and habits;
and, among all the relations of life, that of parent
and child is the best index to degree of advancement.
Filial piety is but the secondary manifestation
of a devotional heart; and attachment
and obedience to a father on earth, are only imperfect
demonstrations of love to our Father in
heaven. What, then&mdash;to apply the principle&mdash;is
the state of this sentiment in the Indian?
By the answer to that question, we shall be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to estimate the value of his religious notions,
and to determine the amount of hope, for his
conversion, justified by their possession. The
answer may be given in a few words: There
is no such sentiment in the Indian character.
Children leave their infirm parents to die alone,
and be eaten by the wolves;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or treat them
with violent indignity,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> when the necessity
of migration gives no occasion for this barbarous
desertion. Young savages have been known
to beat their parents, and even to kill them;
but the display of attachment or reverence for
them, is quite unknown. Like the beast of the
forest, they are no sooner old enough to care
for themselves, than they cease even to remember,
by whose care they have become so; and
the slightest provocation will produce a quarrel
with a father, as readily as with a stranger.
The unwritten law of the Indian, about which
so many writers have dreamed, enacts no higher
penalty for parricide, than for any other homicide;
and a command to honor his father and
mother because they <i>are</i> his father and mother,
would strike the mind of an Indian as simply
absurd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>If the possession of a religion, whose fruits
are no better than these, can, of itself, give
ground for hope to the Christian philanthropist,
let him cherish it fondly. But it is much to be
feared, that the existence of such a system
indefinitely postpones, if it does not entirely
preclude, the Indian's conversion. Even a
bird which has never known the forest, will
eventually escape to the wilds which God has
made its home; and the young Indian, who
has been reared in the city, will fly to the woods
and prairies, and return to the faith of his fathers,
because these, and only these, will satisfy
his nature.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<br />
<p>A theme of praise, in itself more just, has
been the Indian's courage; but the same circumstances
of poetical interest, which have
magnified men's views of his other qualities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
have contributed to exaggerate this also. If
calm steadiness of nerve, in the moment of action,
be an element in true courage, that of the
primitive savage was scarcely genuine. In
all his battles, there were but two possible aspects&mdash;the
furious onset, and the panic retreat:
the firmness which plants itself in line
or square, and stubbornly contends for victory,
was no part of his character. A check, to him,
always resulted in a defeat; and, though this
might, in some measure, be the consequence
of that want of discipline, which is incident to
the savage state, the remark applies with equal
justice, whether he fought singly or in a body.
He was easily panic-struck, because the impulse
of the forward movement was necessary
to keep him strung to effort; and the retrograde
immediately became a rout, because daring,
without constancy, collapses with the first reaction.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enervating influences
attributed to refinement and luxury, genuine,
steady courage is one of the fruits borne by a
high civilization. It is the result of combination,
thought, and the divinity which attaches
to the cultivated man. And, though it may
seem rather unfair to judge a savage by the
rules of civilization, it has long been received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
as a canon, that true valor bears an inverse ratio
to ferocious cruelty. Of all people yet discovered
upon earth, the Indian is the most
ferocious. We must, therefore, either vary the
meaning of the word, when applied to different
people, or deny the savage the possession of
any higher bravery, than that which lives only
through the onset.</p>

<p>Cunning supplied the place of the nobler
quality; the object of his warfare was to overcome
by wily stratagem, rather than by open
combat. &ldquo;Skill consisted in surprising the
enemy. They followed his trail, to kill him
when he slept; or they lay in ambush near a
village, and watched for an opportunity of suddenly
surprising an individual, or, it might be,
a woman and her children; and, with three
strokes to each, the scalps of the victims being
suddenly taken off, the brave flew back with
his companions, to hang the trophies in his
cabin.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> If they succeeded in taking prisoners,
it was only that they might be reserved
for the most infernal torments, and the gratification
of a brutal ferocity, not the trial and
admiration of the victim's courage, was the
purpose of their infliction.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortitude of the Indian under suffering,
has often been referred to, in evidence of
moral courage. And it is certainly true, that
the display so frequently made of triumph in
the hour of death by torture, indicates,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in
part, an elevation of character, seldom found
among more civilized men. It is, however,
the elevation of a barbarian; and its manifestations
are as much the fruit of impotent
rage, as of a noble fortitude. The prisoner at
the stake knows that there is no escape; and
his intense hatred of his enemies takes the form
of a wish, to deprive them of a triumph. While
his flesh is crisping and crackling in the flames,
therefore, he sings of the scalps he has taken,
and heaps opprobrious epithets upon the heads
of his tormentors. But his song is as much a
cry of agony, as of exultation&mdash;his pain only
adopts this mode of expression. It is quite certain,
also, that he does not suffer so deeply, as
would a white man in the same circumstances.
By long exposure, and the endurance of hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>ships
incident to his savage life, his body acquires
an insensibility akin to that of wild animals.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
His nerves do not shrink or betray a
tendency to spasm, even when a limb is amputated.
Transmitted from one generation to another,
this physical nature has become a peculiarity
of the race. And when assisted by the
fierce hatred above referred to, it is not at all
strange that it should enable him to bear with
fortitude, tortures which would conquer the
firmness of the most resolute white man.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<br />
<p>The Indian's dignified stoicism has been as
much exaggerated, as his courage and fortitude.
It is not quite true that he never expresses
surprise, or becomes loquacious. But
he has a certain stern impassibility of feature&mdash;a
coldness of manner&mdash;which have been mistaken
for dignity. His immobility of countenance,
however, may be the effect of sluggish
sensibilities, or even of dull perceptions;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the same savage vanity, which leads him to
make a display of strength or agility before
friend or enemy, prevents his acknowledging
ignorance, by betraying surprise.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> We have
been in company with Indians from the Far
West, while they saw a railroad for the first
time. When they thought themselves unnoticed,
they were as curious about the singular
machinery of the locomotive, and as much excited
by the decorations and appointments of
the cars, as the most ignorant white man. But
the moment they discovered that their movements
were observed, they resumed their dignified
composure; and, if you had judged of
the Indian country by their subsequent deportment,
you might have believed that the vast
prairies of the Missouri were everywhere intersected
by railroads&mdash;that the Indian had, in
fact, never known any other mode of travelling.
&ldquo;On first seeing a steamboat, however,&rdquo;
says Flint, who well understands his character,
&ldquo;he never represses his customary '<i>Ugh</i>!'&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>Generally, among white men, he who is fondest
of inflicting pain, is least able to endure it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
But the Indian reverses almost all the principles,
which apply to civilized life; and, accordingly,
we find that, with all his so-called
fortitude, he is the most intensely cruel of all
living men. Before possession of the continent
was taken by Europeans, war was more constantly
the occupation of his life, than it has
been since; but even now his only object in
taking his enemies alive, is to subject them to
the most inhuman tortures.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And in these
brutal orgies, the women are most active, even
taking the lead, in applying the cord and the
brand.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Nor is this cruelty confined to enemies,
as the practice of leaving the aged and
infirm to die of starvation sufficiently proves.</p>

<p>And his treachery is equal to his cruelty.
No treaty can bind him longer than superior
force compels him to observe it. The discovery
that his enemy is unprepared for an attack, is
sufficient reason to him for making it; his only
object in concluding peace, is to secure an ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>vantage
in war; and before the prospect of a
bloody inroad, his faith melts away, like snow
before the sun. The claims of gratitude he seldom
acknowledges; he cherishes the memory
of a benefit, only until he finds an opportunity
of repaying it with an injury; and forbearance
to avenge the latter, only encourages its repetition.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The numerous pretty stories published
of Indian gratitude, are either exceptional
cases, or unmixed romances.</p>

<p>There have been some tribes of Indians in a
measure reclaimed from their state of barbarism;
the Cherokees, I believe, (and perhaps one
or two other nations,) have even increased in
numbers, under the influence of civilization. But
this is the result of numerous favorable causes
combined, and proves nothing, from which to
infer the Indian's docility. Other savages, on
coming in contact with civilized men, have discovered
a disposition to acquire some of the
useful arts&mdash;their comforts have been increased,
their sufferings diminished, and their condition
ameliorated, by the grafting of new ideas upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the old. But, between the red man and the
white, contiguity has brought about little more
than an exchange of vices.</p>

<p>Almost the only things coveted by the &ldquo;redskin&rdquo;
from the &ldquo;paleface,&rdquo; were his arms, his
trinkets, and his &ldquo;firewater.&rdquo; He could appreciate
whatsoever gave him superiority in war,
gratified his childish vanity, or ministered to
his brutal appetite. But the greater comfort
of the white man's house&mdash;the higher excellence
of his boat&mdash;his improved agricultural
implements or extended learning&mdash;none of
these things appealed to the Indian's passions
or desires. The arts of peace were nothing to
him&mdash;refinement was worse than nothing. He
would spend hours in <i>decorating</i> his person,
but not a moment in <i>cleansing</i> it: I believe
no tradition exists of an Indian ever having
used soap or bought a fine-tooth comb! He is,
indeed, a &ldquo;pattern of filthiness;&rdquo; but even in
civilized life, we find that this is not at all incompatible
with an extravagant love of ornament;
and, in this respect, the savage is not
behind his more enlightened brethren and sisters.
Beads, ribands, and scarlet cloth&mdash;with
powder and lead, guns, tomahawks, and knives&mdash;are
the acquisitions which he prizes most
highly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Pre-eminent, however, above all these in his
estimation, is the greatest curse which has yet
reached him&mdash;the liquid fire called whiskey!
He is, by nature, a drunkard, and the fury of
his intoxication equals the ferocity of his warfare.
&ldquo;All words would be thrown away,&rdquo;
says Mr. Flint,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> &ldquo;in attempting to portray, in
just colors, the effects of whiskey upon such a
race.&rdquo; Fire should be kept away from combustibles&mdash;whiskey
from the Indian, and for
the same reason. With drunkenness, he possesses,
also, its inseparable companion, the vice
of gambling.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He is the most inveterate
gamester: Before the demon of avarice everything
gives way. He even forgets his taciturnity,
in the excitement of the game, and becomes
loquacious and eager. He will stake all
his most valuable possessions, and, losing these,
will even risk his own liberty, or life, on the
turn of a card. We were once witness to a
game in San Antonio (in Western Texas),
among a party of Lipans,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> a race of fine-looking
men, who range the table-lands north of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
sources of the Nueces. Two of them, one the
handsomest warrior among them, lost, first, the
money, which they had just received as the
price of skins, brought to the city for sale. They
then staked, successively, their horses, their
arms, their moccasins, and their blankets. The
&ldquo;luck&rdquo; was against them&mdash;everything was lost;
and we supposed the game was over. But&mdash;as
a last resource, like drawing blood from
their beating hearts&mdash;each produced a <i>little
leathern bottle</i>, containing whiskey! And, as
if these possessed a higher value than all the
articles yet lost, the game went on with increased
interest! Even the potent &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;
thus evoked, could not prevail upon Fortune to
change her face: the whiskey was lost with
the rest! Each rose to his feet, with the usual
guttural exclamation, and, afoot, and unarmed
as he was, silently took his way to the prairies;
while the winners collected in a group, and
with much glee, proceeded to consume the
liquid poison so cheaply obtained.</p>

<br />
<p>We come, finally to the question of the Indian's
fate: What is to become of the race?
The answer presents no difficulties, save such
as grow out of men's unwillingness to look unpleasant
truths in the face. There has been,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of late years, much lamentation, among our
own people, over the gradual extinction of
these interesting savages; and in Europe we
have been made the subject of indignant eloquence,
for (what those, who know nothing
about it, are pleased to call) &ldquo;our oppression
of the Indian.&rdquo; But, in the first place, the decay
of the American races is neither so rapid
nor so universal, as is generally supposed;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and, in the second place, if the fact were otherwise,
we could, at the worst, be charged only
with accelerating a depopulation already begun.
&ldquo;The ten thousand mounds in the Mississippi
Valley, the rude memorials of an immensely
numerous former population, but, to
our view, no more civilized than the present
races, are proofs that the country <i>was depopulated</i>,
when the white man first became acquainted
with it. If we can infer nothing else
from these mounds, we can clearly infer, that
this country once had its millions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
had become of this immense population? The
successive invasions of new hordes of barbarians
from the north, intestine wars, and the
law, that men shall advance toward civilization,
or decay from the earth&mdash;these are the
only causes to which we may ascribe their disappearance.</p>

<p>The extinction of the Indian race is decreed,
by a law of Providence which we can not gainsay.
Barbarism <i>must</i> give way to civilization.
It is not only inevitable, but <i>right</i>, that it
should be so. The tide of empire, which has
been flowing since the earliest times, has set
steadily toward the West. The Indian emigrated
in the wrong direction: and now, after
the lapse of many centuries, the descendants of
the first Asians, having girdled the globe, meet
on the banks of the Mississippi! On the one
side, are enlightenment, civilization, Christianity:
on the other, darkness, degradation, barbarism:
and the question arises, which shall
give way? The Indian recedes: at the rate of

assigning a common origin to all nations,&mdash;though the last

think, authorize the assumption.</p></div>

<h3>THE VOYAGEUR.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Spread out earth's holiest records here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of days and deeds to reverence dear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zeal like this, what pious legends tell?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The shapeless knight-errantry of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, rich as it was
in romance and adventure, is not to be compared,
in any valuable characteristic, to the
noiseless self-devotion of the men who first explored
the Western country. The courage of
the knight was a part of his savage nature; his
confidence was in the strength of his own right
arm; and if his ruggedness was ever softened
down by gentler thoughts, it was only when he
asked forgiveness for his crimes, or melted in
sensual idolatry of female beauty.</p>

<p>It would be a curious and instructive inquiry,
could we institute it with success, how much
of the contempt of danger manifested by the
wandering knight was referable to genuine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
valor, and what proportion to the strength of
a Milan coat, and the temper of a Toledo or
Ferrara blade. And it would be still more
curious, although perhaps not so instructive, to
estimate the purity and fidelity of the heroines
of chivalry; to ascertain the amount of true devotion
given them by their admirers, &ldquo;without
hope of reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But without abating its interest by invidious
and ungrateful inquiries, we can see quite enough&mdash;in
its turbulence, its cruelty, arrogance, and
oppression&mdash;to make us thank Heaven that
&ldquo;the days of chivalry are gone.&rdquo; And from
that chaotic scene of rapine, raid, and murder,
we can turn with pleasure to contemplate the
truer, nobler chivalry&mdash;the chivalry of love and
peace, whose weapons were the kindness of
their hearts, the purity of their motives, and
the self-denial of their lives.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;<i>voyageur</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> literally signifies
&ldquo;traveller;&rdquo; and by this modest name are indicated
some of the bravest adventurers the
world has ever seen. But it is not in its usual,
common-place signification that I employ the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
word, nor yet in that which is given it by most
writers on the subject of early French settlements
and explorations. Men are often affected
by the names given them, either of opprobrium
or commendation; but words are quite as frequently
changed, restricted, or enlarged in
meaning, by their application to men. For
example: you apply the word soldier to a class
of men; and if robbery be one of the characteristics
of that class, &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; will soon come to
mean &ldquo;robber&rdquo; too. And thus, though the
parallel is only logical, has it been with the
term &ldquo;<i>voyageur</i>.&rdquo; The class of men to whom
it is applied were travellers&mdash;<i>voyageurs</i>; but
they were <i>more</i>; and as the habits and qualities
of men came in time to be better understood
than the meaning of French words, the
term, used in reference to Western history,
took much of its significance from the history
and character of the men it assumed to describe.
Thus, <i>un voyageur</i> means not only a
traveller, but a traveller with a purpose; an
adventurer among the Western wilds; a chivalrous
missionary, either in the cause of science
or religion. It includes high courage,
burning zeal for church and country, and the
most generous self-devotion. It describes such
men as Marquette, La Salle, Joliet, Gravier,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and hundreds of others equally illustrious, who
lived and died among the dangers and privations
of the wilderness; who opened the way
for civilization and Christianity among the
savages, and won, many of them, crowns of
martyrdom.</p>

<p>They were almost all Frenchmen. The
Spaniards who came to this continent were
mere gold-seekers, thirsting only for wealth;
and if they sought to propagate Christianity,
or rather the Christian <i>name</i>, it was only a
sanguinary bigotry that prompted them. On
the other hand, the English emigrants came to
take possession of the country for themselves.
The conversion of the natives, or territorial acquisition
for the mother-country, were to them
objects of barely secondary importance. They
believed themselves persecuted&mdash;some of them
<i>were</i> persecuted&mdash;and they fled: it was only
safety for themselves, and the rich lands of the
Indian, that they sought. Providence reserved
for the French chevaliers and missionaries the
glory of leaving their homes without compulsion,
real or imaginary, to penetrate an inhospitable
wilderness; to undergo fatigues; to
encounter dangers, and endure privations of a
thousand kinds; enticed by no golden glitter,
covetous of no riches, save such as are &ldquo;laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
up in heaven!&rdquo; They came not as conquerors,
but as ministers of peace, demanding only hospitality.
They never attacked the savages with
sword or fagot; but extending hands not stained
by blood, they justified their profession by relief
and love and kindly offices. Sometimes, indeed,
they received little tracts of land; not seized
by the hand of power, nor grasped by superior
cunning, but possessed as the free gift of simple
gratitude; and upon these they lived in
peace, surrounded by savages, but protected
by the respect inspired by blameless and beneficent
lives. Many of those whose vows permitted
it, intermarried among the converted natives,
and left the seeds of many meliorations in
a stony soil; and many of them, when they
died, were as sincerely mourned by the simple
children of the forest, as if they had been chiefs
and braves.</p>

<p>Such were the men of peace who penetrated
the wilderness through the French settlements
in Canada, and preached the gospel to the
heathen, where no white man had ever before
been seen; and it is particularly to this class
that I apply the word at the head of this article.
But the same gentle spirit pervaded other
orders of adventurers&mdash;men of the sword and
buckler, as well as of the stole and surplice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
These came to establish the dominion of <i>La
Belle France</i>; but it was not to oppress the
simple native, or to drive him from his lands.
Kindness marked even the conduct of the rough
soldier; and such men as La Salle, and Iberville,
who were stern enough in war, and rigid enough
in discipline, manifested always an anxious solicitude
for the <i>rights</i>, as well as for the spiritual
welfare of the Indian. They gave a generous
confidence where they were conscious of no wish
to injure; they treated frankly and on equal
terms, with those whom their religion and their
native kindness alike taught them to consider
brethren and friends. Take, for example, that
significant anecdote of La Salle, related by the
faithful chronicler<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of his unfortunate expeditions.
He was building the fort of <i>Crevec&#339;ur</i>,
near the spot where now stands the city of Peoria,
on the Illinois river; and even the name
of his little fortress (<i>Crevec&#339;ur</i>, Broken Heart)
was a mournful record of his shattered fortunes.
The means of carrying out his noble enterprise
(the colonizing of the Mississippi valley) were
lost; the labor of years had been rendered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>effectual
by one shipwreck; his men were discontented,
even mutinous, &ldquo;attempting,&rdquo; says
Hennepin, &ldquo;first to poison, and then desert
him;&rdquo; his mind was distracted, his heart almost
broken, by accumulated disasters. Surrounded
thus by circumstances which might
well have rendered him careless of the feelings
of the savages around him, he observed that
they had become cold and distant&mdash;that in
effect they no longer viewed him as their
friend. The Iroquois,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> drifting from the shores
of Lake Ontario, where they had always been
the bitterest foes of the French, had instilled
fear and hatred into their minds; it was even
said that some of his own men had encouraged
the growing discontent. In this juncture, what
measures does he take? Strengthen his fortifications,
and prepare for war, as the men of
other nations had done? Far from it. Soldier
and adventurer as he was, he had no wish to
shed innocent blood; though with his force he
might have defied all the nations about him.
He went as a friend, frankly and generously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
among them, and demanded the reasons of
their discontent. He touched their hearts by
his confidence, convinced them of his friendship,
and attached them to himself more devotedly
than ever. A whole history in one brief
passage!</p>

<p>But it is more especially to the <i>voyageurs</i> of
the church&mdash;the men of faith and love&mdash;that I
wish to direct my readers' attention: To such men
as Le Caron, a Franciscan, with all the zeal and
courage and self-abnegation of his order, who
wandered and preached among the bloody Iroquois,
and upon the waters of Huron, as early
as 1616: to Mesnard, a devoted missionary of
the same order, who, in 1660, founded a mission
at the Sault de Ste. Marie, and then went into
the forest to induce the savages to listen to the
glad tidings he had brought, and never came
back: to Father Allouez, who rebuilt the mission
five years afterward (the first of these
houses of God which was not destroyed or
abandoned), who subsequently crossed the
lakes, and preached to the Indians on Fox
river, where, in one of the villages of the Miamis
and Mascoutens, Marquette found a cross
still standing, after the lapse of years, where
Allouez had raised it, covered with the offerings
of the simple natives to an unknown God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
He is the same, too, who founded Kaskaskia,
probably the earliest settlement in the great
valley, and whose history ends (significant
fact!) with the record of his usefulness. To
Father Pinet, who founded Cahokia, and was
so successful in the conversion of the natives,
that his little chapel could not contain the
numbers who resorted to his ministrations: to
Father Marest, the first preacher against intemperance;
and, finally, to Marquette, the best
and bravest of them all, the most single-hearted
and unpretending!</p>

<br />
<p>Enthusiasm is a characteristic of the French
nation; a trait in some individuals elevated to
a sublime self-devotion, and in others degraded
to mere excitability. The vivacity, gesticulation,
and grimace, which characterize most of
them, are the external signs of this nature; the
calm heroism of the seventeenth century, and
the insane devotion of the nineteenth, were
alike its fruits. The <i>voyageur</i> possessed it, in
common with all his countrymen. But in him
it was not noisy, turbulent, or egotistical;
military glory had &ldquo;neither part nor lot&rdquo; in
his schemes; the conquests he desired to make
were the conquests of faith; the dominion he
wished to establish was the dominion of Jesus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>In the pursuit of these objects, or rather of
this single object, I have said he manifested the
enthusiasm of his race; but it was the noblest
form of that characteristic. The fire that
burned in his bosom was fed by no selfish purpose.
To have thought of himself, or of his
own comforts, or glory, to the detriment of any
Christian enterprise, however dangerous or unpromising,
would, in his eyes, have been a
deadly sin.</p>

<br />
<p>At Sault de Ste. Marie, Father Marquette
heard of many savages (whom he calls &ldquo;God's
children&rdquo;) living in barbarism, far to the west.
With five boatmen and one companion, he at
once set out for an unexplored, even unvisited
wilderness. He had what they had not&mdash;the
gospel; and his heart yearned toward them, as
the heart of a mother toward an afflicted child.
He went to them, and bound them to him &ldquo;in
the bond of peace.&rdquo; If they received him kindly&mdash;as
they usually did, for even a savage recognises
and respects genuine devotion&mdash;he
preached to them, mediated among them, softened
their hearts, and gathered them into the
fold of God. If they met him with arms in their
hands&mdash;as they sometimes did, for savages,
like civilized men, do not always know their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
friends&mdash;he resolutely offered peace; and, in
his own simple and pious language, &ldquo;God
touched their hearts,&rdquo; and they cast aside their
weapons and received him kindly.</p>

<p>But the <i>voyageur</i> had higher qualities than
enthusiasm. He was capable of being so absorbed
in a cause as to lose sight of his own
identity; to forget that he was more than an
instrument in the hands of God, to do God's
work: and the distinction between these traits
is broad indeed! Enthusiasm is noisy, obtrusive&mdash;self-abnegation
is silent, retiring; enthusiasm
is officious, troublesome, careless of time
and place&mdash;self-abnegation is prudent, gentle,
considerate. The one is active and fragmentary&mdash;the
other passive, but constant.</p>

<p>Thus, when the untaught and simple native
was to be converted, the missionary took note
of the spiritual capacity as well as of the spiritual
wants; he did not force him to receive, at
once, the whole creed of the church, as a mere
enthusiast would have done; for <i>that</i> wisdom
would feed an infant with strong meats, even
before it had drawn its mother's milk. Neither
did he preach the gospel with the sword, like
the Spaniard, nor with fire and fagot, like the
puritan. He was wise as the serpent, but
gentle as the dove. He took the wondering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Indian by the hand; received him as a brother;
won him over to listen patiently; and then
taught him first that which he could most easily
comprehend: he led him to address the throne
of grace, or, in the language of the time, &ldquo;to
embrace the prayer;&rdquo; because even the savage
believed in Deity. As his understanding was
expanded, and his heart purified&mdash;as every
heart must be which truly lifts itself to God&mdash;he
gradually taught him the more abstruse and
wonderful doctrines of the Church of Christ.
Gently and imperceptibly he led him on, until
the whole tremendous work was done. The untutored
savage, if he knew nothing else, yet
knew the name of his Redeemer. The bloody
warfare, the feuds and jealousies of his tribe,
if not completely overcome, at least were softened
and ameliorated. When he could not
convert, he endeavored to humanize; and
among the tribes of the Illinois,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> though they
were never thoroughly Christianized, the influence
of the good fathers soon prevailed to abolish
the barbarous practice of torturing captives.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
For though they might not embrace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the religion, the savages venerated its teachers,
and loved them for their gentleness.</p>

<p>And this gentleness was not want of courage;
for never in the history of the world has truer
valor been exhibited than that shown by the
early missionary and his compeers, the first
military adventurers! Read Joutel's account
of the melancholy life and death of La Salle;
read the simple, unpretending &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; of
Marquette;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and compare their constancy and
heroism with that displayed at any time in any
cause! But the <i>voyageur</i> possessed higher
qualities than courage, also; and here again we
recur to his perfect abnegation of himself; his
renunciation of all personal considerations.</p>

<p>Courage takes note of danger, but defies it:
the <i>voyageur</i> was careless of danger, because
he counted it as nothing; he gave it no thought,
because it only affected <i>himself</i>; and he valued
not his own safety and comfort, so long as he
could serve the cause by forgetting them. Mere
courage is combative, even pugnacious; but
the <i>voyageur</i> fought only &ldquo;the good fight;&rdquo; he
had no pride of conquest, save in the victories
of Faith, and rather would suffer, himself, than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
inflict suffering upon others. Mere courage is
restless, impatient, purposeless: but the <i>voyageur</i>
was content to remain wherever he could
do good, tentative only in the cause of Christ,
and distracted by no objects from his mission.
His religion was his inspiration; his conscience
his reward. His system may have been perverted,
his zeal mistaken, his church a sham;
we are not arguing that question. But the
purity of his intentions, the sincerity of his
heart, can not be doubted; and the most intolerant
protestant against &ldquo;the corruptions of
Rome&rdquo; will, at least, admit that even catholicism
was better than the paganism of the savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; says Macaulay,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> &ldquo;and there
never was on this earth, a work of human policy
so well deserving of examination as the Roman
Catholic Church.&rdquo; And certainly all other
systems combined have never produced one
tithe of the astounding results brought about
by this alone. Whether she has taught truth
or falsehood; whether, on the whole, it had
been better or worse for the cause of Christianity,
had no such organization ever existed;
whether her claims be groundless or well-founded,
are questions foreign to our purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
But that her polity is the most powerful&mdash;the
best adapted to the ends she has in view&mdash;of all
that man has hitherto invented, there can be no
doubt. Her missionaries have been more numerous
and more successful, ay, and more devoted,
than those of any other church. They
have gone where even the sword of the conqueror
could not cleave his way. They have
built churches in the wilderness, which were
time-worn and crumbling when the first emigrant
penetrated the forests. They have preached
to youthful savages who never saw the face
of another white man, though they lived to
three-score years and ten. They have prayed
upon the shores of lonely lakes and rivers,
which were not mapped by geographers for
centuries after their deaths. They have travelled
on foot, unarmed and alone, where an
army could not march. And everywhere their
zeal and usefulness have ended only with their
lives; and always with their latest breath
they have mingled prayers for the salvation of
their flocks, with aspirations for the welfare of
their church. For though countless miles of sea
and land were between her and them, their
loyalty and affection to the great spiritual
Mother were never forgotten. &ldquo;In spite of
oceans and deserts; of hunger and pestilence;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of spies and penal laws; of dungeons and
racks, of gibbets and quartering-blocks,&rdquo; they
have been found in every country, at all times,
ever active and zealous. And everywhere, in
palace, or hovel, or wilderness, they have been
true sons of the church, loyal and obedient.</p>

<p>An organization capable of producing such
results is certainly well worth examination.
For the influence she has wielded in ages past
gives promise of her future power; and it becomes
those who think her permanence pernicious
to the world, to avoid her errors and yet
imitate her wisdom. If the system be a falsehood
and a sham, it is a most gigantic and successful
one, and it is of strange longevity. It
has lived now more than fifteen hundred years,
and one hundred and fifty millions of people
yet believe it. If it be a counterfeit, it is high
time the cheat were detected and exposed. Let
those who have the truth give forth its light,
that the falsehood may wither and die. Unless
they do so, the life which has already extended
over so many centuries may gain fresh vigor,
and renew its youth. Even yet the vision of
the essayist may be realized: &ldquo;She may still
exist in undiminished vigor, when some traveller
from New Zealand shall, in the midst of a
vast solitude, take his stand on a broken arch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St.
Paul's!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was to this church that the early <i>voyageurs</i>
belonged. And I do not use that word
&ldquo;belonged&rdquo; as it is employed in modern times
among protestants: I mean <i>more</i> than that convenient,
loosely-fitting profession, which, like a
garment, is thrown on and off, as the exigencies
of hypocrisy or cupidity may require. These
men actually <i>did belong</i> to the church. They
were hers, soul and body; hers, in life and in
death; hers to go whithersoever she might direct,
to do whatsoever she might appoint. They
believed the doctrines they taught with an abiding,
<i>active</i> faith; and they were willing to be
spent in preaching them to the heathen.</p>

<br />
<p>It has always been a leading principle in the
policy of the Roman church, to preserve her
unity, and she has been enabled to do so, principally
by the ramified and elastic polity for
which she has been distinguished, to which she
owes much of her extent and power, as well as
no small part of the reproach so liberally bestowed
upon her in the pages of history. There
are many &ldquo;arms&rdquo; in her service: a man must
be impracticable indeed, when she can find no
place in which to make him useful, or to pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>vent
his being mischievous. She never drives
one from the pale of the church who can benefit
it as a communicant, or injure it as a dissenter.
If he became troublesome at home, she has, in
all ages, had enterprises on foot in which she
might clothe him with authority, and send him
to the uttermost parts of the earth; thus ridding
herself of a dangerous member, and, by the
same act, enlarging the sphere of her own dominion.
Does an enthusiast become noisy, or
troublesome upon unimportant points, the creed
is flexible, and the mother will not quarrel with
her child, for his earnestness may convince and
lead astray more valuable sons and daughters.
She will establish a new order, of which the
stubborn fanatic shall be founder; the new order
is built into the old church organization,
and its founder becomes a dignitary of the ecclesiastical
establishment. Instead of becoming
a dangerous heretic and schismatic, he is attached
to orthodoxy by cords stronger than
steel; henceforth all his earnest enthusiasm
shall be directed to the advancement of his order,
and consequently of his church. Does
one exhibit inflexibility in some matter of conscience
upon which the church insists, there
are many of God's children in the wilderness
starving in spirit for the bread of life; and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
these, with that bread, shall the refractory son
be sent. He receives the commission; departs
upon his journey, glad to forget a difference
with his spiritual superiors; preaches to the
heathen; remembers only that the church is
his mother; wins a crown of martyrdom, and is
canonized for the encouragement of others!</p>

<p>Thus she finds a place for all, and work
enough for each; and thus are thrown off the
elements of schism and rebellion. Those who
had most courage in the cause of right; all
who were likely to be guided in matters of conscience
by their own convictions; the most
sincere and single-hearted, the firmest and purest
and bravest, were, in matters of controversy,
the most dangerous champions, should they
range themselves against the teaching of the
church. They were consequently, at the period
of which I am writing, the men whom it was
most desirable to send away; and they were
eminently well fitted for the arduous and wasting
duties of the missionary.</p>

<p>To this class belonged the large majority of
the <i>voyageur</i> priests: men who might be inconvenient
and obtrusive monitors, or formidable
adversaries in controversy, if they remained at
home; but who could only be useful&mdash;who of
all men could be <i>most</i> useful&mdash;in gathering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
heathen into the fold of the church. There
were, doubtless, a few of another class; the
restless, intriguing, and disobedient, who, though
not formidable, were troublesome. But even
when these joined the missionary expeditions,
they did but little to forward the work, and are
entitled to none of the honor so abundantly due
to their more sincere brethren. To this class,
for example, belonged the false and egotistical
Hennepin, who only signalized himself by endeavoring
to appropriate the reputation so
hardly won by the brave and unfortunate La
Salle.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear upon the record that any
of these men&mdash;of either the restless and ambitious,
or of the better class&mdash;were literally
<i>sent away</i>. But such has been the politic practice
of this church for many ages; and we may
safely believe, that when she was engaged in
an unscrupulous and desperate contest for the
recovery, by fair means or foul, of her immense
losses, there might be many in the ranks of her
pious priesthood whom it would be inconvenient
to retain at home. And during that conflict<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
especially, with the most formidable enemies
she ever had, she could not afford to be encumbered.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the motives of
their spiritual superiors, the missionaries themselves
were moved only by the considerations
of which we have spoken&mdash;the truest piety
and the most burning zeal. Of these influences
they were conscious; but we shall perhaps not
do the character injustice if we add another
spur to action, of which they were <i>not</i> conscious.
There is a vein of romance in the
French composition; a love of adventure for
the sake of the adventure itself, which, when
not tamed or directed, makes a Frenchman fitful,
erratic, and unreliable. When it is toned
by personal ambition, it becomes a sort of Paladin
contempt for danger; sometimes a crazy
furor. When accompanied by powerful intellect,
and strengthened by concentration on a
purpose, it makes a great commander&mdash;great
for the quickness of his comprehension, the
suddenness of his resolutions, the rapidity of
their execution. When humanized by love,
and quickened by religious zeal, it is purified
of every selfish thought, and produces the chivalrous
missionary, whom neither fire nor flood,
neither desert nor pathless wilderness, shall de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>ter
from obeying the command of Him who
sent his gospel &ldquo;unto every creature.&rdquo; And
thus are even those traits, which so often curse
the world with insane ambition and sanguinary
war, turned by the power of a true benevolence
to be blessings of incalculable value.</p>

<p>Such were the purposes, such the motives,
of this band of noble men; and whatever may
have been their errors, we must at least accord
them the virtues of <i>sincerity</i>, <i>courage</i>, <i>and self-denial</i>.
But let us look a little more closely at
the means by which they accomplished undertakings
which, to any other race of men, would
have been not only impracticable, but utterly
desperate. Take again, as the representative
of his class, the case of Father Marquette, than
whom, obscure as his name is in the wastes of
history, no man ever lived a more instructive
and exemplary life.</p>

<p>From the year 1668 to 1671,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Marquette had
been preaching at the Sault de Sainte Marie, a
little below the foot of Lake Superior. He was
associated with others in that mission; but the
largest type, though it thrust itself no higher
than the smallest, will make the broadest impress
on the page of history; and even in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
meager record of that time, we may trace the
influence of his gentle but firm spirit&mdash;those
by whom he was accompanied evidently took
their tone from him. But he was one of the
Church's pioneers; that class whose eager,
single-hearted zeal is always pushing forward
to new conquests of the faith; and when he
had put aside the weapons that opposed their
way, to let his followers in, his thoughts at once
went on to more remote and suffering regions.
During his residence at the Sault, rumors and
legends were continually floating in of the unknown
country lying to the west&mdash;&ldquo;the Land
of the Great River,&rdquo; the Indians called it&mdash;until
the mind of the good father became fully
possessed with the idea of going to convert the
nations who dwelt upon its shores. In the year
1671, he took the first step in that direction,
moving on to Point St. Ignatius, on the main
land, north of the island of Mackinac. Here,
surrounded by his little flock of wondering
listeners, he preached until the spring of 1673;
but all the time his wish to carry the gospel
where its sound had never been heard was
growing stronger. He felt in his heart the impulse
of his calling, to lead the way and open
a path for the advance of light. At the period
mentioned, he received an order from the wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
intendant in New France, M. Talon, to explore
the pathless wilderness to the westward.</p>

<p>Then was seen the true spirit of the man, and
of his order. He gathered together no armament;
asked the protection of no soldiers; no
part of the cargo of his little boat consisted of
gunpowder, or of swords or guns; his only arms
were the spirit of love and peace; his trust was
in God for protection. Five boatmen, and one
companion, the Sieur Joliet, composed his party.
Two light bark canoes were his only means
of travelling; and in these he carried a small
quantity of Indian corn and some jerked meat,
his only means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, he set out through Green Bay
and up Fox river, in search of a country never
yet visited by any European. The Indians endeavored
to dissuade him, wondering at his
hardihood, and still more at the motives which
could induce him thus to brave so many dangers.
They told him of the savage Indians, to
whom it would be only pastime to torture and
murder him; of the terrible monsters which
would swallow him and his companions,
&ldquo;canoes and all;&rdquo; of the great bird called
the <i>Piasau</i>,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> which devoured men, after car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>rying
them in its horrible talons to inaccessible
cliffs and mountains; and of the scorching
heat, which would wither him like a dry leaf.
&ldquo;I thanked them kindly,&rdquo; says the resolute but
gentle father, &ldquo;for their good counsel; but I
told them that I could not profit by it, since the
salvation of souls was at stake, for which object
I would be overjoyed to give my life.&rdquo; Shaking
them by the hand, one by one, as they approached
to bid him farewell, as they thought,
for the last time, he turned his back upon safety
and peace, and departed upon his self-denying
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Let him who sits at ease in his cushioned
pew at home&mdash;let him who lounges on his velvet-covered
sofa in the pulpit, while his well-taught
choir are singing; who rises as the
strains are dying, and kneels upon a cushioned
stool to pray; who treads upon soft carpets
while he preaches, in a white cravat, to congregations
clad in broadcloth, silk, and satin&mdash;let
him pause and ponder on the difference
between his works, his trials, his zeal&mdash;ay, and
his glory, both of earth and heaven!&mdash;and those
of Father James Marquette!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>The little party went upon their way; the
persuasions of their simple-hearted friends could
not prevail, for the path of duty was before
them, and the eye of God above. Having
passed through Green Bay, and painfully
dragged their canoes over the rapids of Fox
river, they reached a considerable village, inhabited
by the united tribes of Kickapoos, Miamis,
and Mascoutimes. Here they halted for
a time, as the mariner, about to prove the dangers
of a long voyage, lingers for a day in the
last port he is likely to enter for many months.
Beyond this point no white man had ever
gone; and here, if anywhere, the impulses of
a natural fear should have made themselves
felt. But we hear of no hesitation, no shrinking
from the perilous task; and we know from
the unpretending &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; of the good father,
that a retreat, nay, even a halt&mdash;longer than
was necessary to recruit exhausted strength, and
renew the memory of former lessons among the
natives&mdash;was never thought of. &ldquo;My companion,&rdquo;
said Marquette, referring to Joliet, &ldquo;is
an envoy from the king of France, and I am
an humble minister of God. I have no fear, <i>because
I shall consider it the highest happiness
to die in the service of my master!</i>&rdquo; There
was no bravado in this, for, unlike many from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
whom you may, any day, hear the same declaration,
he set forth immediately to encounter
the perils of his embassy.</p>

<p>The Indians, unable to prevail with him to
abandon the enterprise, made all their simple
provision for his comfort; and, furnishing him
with guides and carriers across the portage to
the Wisconsin river, parted with him as one
bound for eternity. Having brought them
safely to the river, the guides left them &ldquo;alone
in that unknown country, in the hand of God;&rdquo;
and, trusting to the protection of that hand,
they set out upon their journey down the
stream.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Seven days after, &ldquo;with inexpressible
joy,&rdquo; they emerged upon the bosom of
the great river. During all this time they
had seen no human being, though, probably,
many a wandering savage had watched them
from the covert of the bank, as they floated
silently between the forests. It was an unbroken
solitude, where the ripple of their paddles
sounded loudly on the ear, and their voices,
subdued by the stillness, were sent back in
lonely echoes from the shore.</p>

<p>They were the first white men who ever
floated on the bosom of that mighty river<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>&mdash;&ldquo;the
envoy from the king of France, and the
embassador of the King of kings.&rdquo; What were
their thoughts we know not, but from Marquette's
simple &ldquo;Journal;&rdquo; for, in returning to
Quebec, Joliet's boat was wrecked in sight of
the city, and all his papers lost.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Of the Sieur
himself, we know nothing, save as the companion
of Marquette on this voyage; but from
this alone his fame is imperishable.</p>

<p>They sailed slowly down the river, keeping
a constant outlook upon the banks for signs of
those for whose spiritual welfare the good father
had undertaken his perilous journey. But
for more than sixty leagues not a human form
or habitation could be seen. They had leisure,
more than they desired, to admire the grand
and beautiful scenery of that picturesque region.
In some places the cliffs rose perpendicularly
for hundreds of feet from the water's
edge; and nodding over their brows, and
towering against the sky, were stately pines
and cedars of the growth of centuries. Here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
there lay between the river and the cliffs, a
level prairie, waving in all the luxuriance of
&ldquo;the leafy month of June;&rdquo; while beyond, the
bluffs, enclosing the natural garden, softened
by the distance, and clothed in evergreen,
seemed but an extension of the primitive savanna.
Here, a dense, primeval forest grew
quite down to the margin of the water; and,
hanging from the topmost branches of the
giant oaks, festoons of gray and graceful moss
lay floating on the rippled surface, or dipped
within the tide. Here, the large, smooth roots of
trees half undermined, presented seats and footholds,
where the pleasant shade invited them to
rest, and shelter from the sultry summer sun.
Anon, an open prairie, with no cliff or bluff
beyond, extended undulating from the river,
until the eye, in straining to measure its extent,
was wearied by the effort, and the plain became
a waving sea of rainbow colors; of green
and yellow, gold and purple. Again, they
passed a gravelly beach, on which the yellow
sand was studded with a thousand sets of brilliant
shells, and little rivulets flowed in from
level prairies, or stealthily crept out from under
roots of trees or tangled vines, and hastened
to be hidden in the bosom of the great father
of waters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>They floated on, through the dewy morning
hours, when the leaves were shining in the sunlight,
and the birds were singing joyously; before
the summer heat had dried the moisture,
or had forced the feathered songsters to the
shade. At noon, when the silence made the
solitude oppressive; when the leaves hung
wilting down, nor fluttered in the fainting
wind: when the prairies were no longer waving
like the sea, but trembling like the atmosphere
around a heated furnace: when the <i>mirage</i>
hung upon the plain: tall trees were seen
growing in the air, and among them stalked
the deer, and elk, and buffalo: while between
them and the ground, the brazen sky was glowing
with the sun of June: when nothing living
could be seen, save when the <i>voyageur's</i> approach
would startle some wild beast slaking
his thirst in the cool river, or a flock of waterfowl
were driven from their covert, where the
willow branches, drooping, dipped their leaves
of silvery gray within the water. They floated
on till evening, when the sun approached the
prairie, and his broad, round disc, now shorn of
its dazzling beams, defined itself against the
sky and grew florid in the gathering haze:
when the birds began to reappear, and flitted
noiselessly among the trees, in busy prepara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>tion
for the night: when beasts of prey crept
out from lurking-places, where they had dozed
and panted through the hours of noon: when
the wilderness grew vocal with the mingled
sounds of lowing buffalo, and screaming panther,
and howling wolf; until the shadows rose
from earth, and travelled from the east; until
the dew began to fall, the stars came out, and
night brought rest and dreams of home!</p>

<p>Thus they floated on, &ldquo;from morn till dewy
eve,&rdquo; and still no sign of human life, neither
habitation nor footprint, until one day&mdash;it was
the twenty-fifth of June, more than two weeks
since they had entered the wilderness&mdash;in
gliding past a sandy beach, they recognised
the impress of a naked foot! Following it for
some distance, it grew into a trail, and then a
path, once more a place where human beings
habitually walked.</p>

<p>Whose feet had trodden down the grass, what
strange people lived on the prairies, they knew
not, what dangers might await them, they cared
not. These were the people whom the good
father had come so far to convert and save!
And now, again, one might expect some natural
hesitation; some doubt in venturing among
those who were certainly barbarians, and who
might, for aught they knew, be brutal canni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>bals.
We could forgive a little wavering, indeed,
especially when we think of the frightful
stories told them by the Northern Indians of
this very people. But fear was not a part of
these men's nature; or if it existed, it lay so
deep, buried beneath religious zeal and pious
trust, that its voice never reached the upper
air. Leaving the boatmen with the canoes,
near the mouth of the river now called Des
Moines, Marquette and Joliet set out alone,
to follow up the trail, and seek the people
who had made it. It led them to an open
prairie, one of the most beautiful in the present
state of Iowa, and crossing this, a distance of
six miles, they at last found themselves in the
vicinity of three Indian villages. The very
spot<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> where the chief of these stood might now
be easily found, so clear, though brief, is the
description of the simple priest. It stood at the
foot of a long slope, on the bank of the river
Moingona (or Des Moines), about six miles due
west of the Mississippi; and at the top of the
rise, at the distance of half a league, were built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the two others. &ldquo;We commended ourselves
unto God,&rdquo; writes the gentle father; for they
knew not at what moment they might need his
intervention; and crying out with a loud voice,
to announce their approach, they calmly advanced
toward the group of lodges. At a short
distance from the entrance to the village, they
were met by a deputation of four old men, who,
to their great joy, they perceived bore a richly-ornamented
pipe of peace, the emblem of friendship
and hospitality. Tendering the mysterious
calumet, they informed the Frenchmen that
they belonged to one of the tribes called &ldquo;Illinois&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;Men&rdquo;), and invited them to enter
their lodges in peace: an invitation which the
weary <i>voyageurs</i> were but too glad to accept.</p>

<p>A great council was held, with all the rude
but imposing ceremonies of the grave and dignified
Indian; and before the assembled chiefs
and braves, Marquette published his mission
from his heavenly Master. Passing, then, from
spiritual to temporal things&mdash;for we do not
hear of any address from Joliet, who probably
was no orator&mdash;he spoke of his earthly king,
and of his viceroy in New France; of his victories
over the Iroquois, the dreaded enemies
of the peaceful Western tribes; and then made
many inquiries about the Mississippi, its tribu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>taries,
and the nations who dwelt upon their
banks. His advances were kindly received,
his questions frankly answered, and the council
broke up with mutual assurances of good-will.
Then ensued the customary festival. Hominy,
fish, buffalo, and <i>dog-meat</i>, were successively
served up, like the courses of a more modern
table; but of <i>the last</i> &ldquo;we declined to partake,&rdquo;
writes the good father, no doubt much to the
astonishment and somewhat to the chagrin of
their hospitable friends; for even yet, among
the western Indians, dog-meat is a dish of honor.</p>

<p>Six days of friendly intercourse passed pleasantly
away, diversified by many efforts on the
part of Marquette to instruct and convert the
docile savages. Nor were these entirely without
result; they excited, at least, the wish to
hear more; and on his departure they crowded
round him, and urgently requested him to come
again among them. He promised to do so, a
pledge which he afterward redeemed. But
now he could not tarry; he was bent upon his
hazardous voyage down the Great River, and
he knew that he was only on the threshold of
his grand discoveries. Six hundred warriors,
commanded by their most distinguished chief,
accompanied him back to his boats; and, after
hanging around his neck the great calumet, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
protect him among the hostile nations of the
south, they parted with him, praying that the
Great Spirit, of whom he had told them, might
give him a prosperous voyage, and a speedy
and safe return.</p>

<br />
<p>These were the first of the nations of the
Mississippi Valley visited by the French, and
it is from them that the state of Illinois takes
its name. They were a singularly gentle people;
and a nature originally peaceful had been rendered
almost timid by the cruel inroads of the
murderous Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> These, by their traffic
with the Dutch and English of New-York, and
by their long warfare with the French of Canada,
had acquired the use of fire-arms, and, of
course, possessed an immense advantage over
those who were armed only with the primitive
bow and arrow. The restless and ambitious
spirit of the singular confederacy, usually called
the Five Nations, and known among their
neighbors by the collective name of Iroquois,
had carried their incursions even as far as
the hunting-grounds of the Shawanese, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the mouth of the Ohio; and their successes
had made them a terror to all the western
tribes. The Illinois, therefore, knowing the
French to be at war with these formidable enemies,
were the more anxious to form an alliance
with them; and the native gentleness of their
manners was, perhaps, increased by the hope
of assistance and protection. But, whatever
motives may have influenced them, besides
their natural character, their forethought was
of vital service to the wanderers in the countries
of the south, whither they proceeded.</p>

<p>The little party of seven resumed their voyage
on the last day of June, and floating with
the rapid current, a few days afterward passed
the rocks, above the site of Alton, where was
painted the image of the ravenous <i>Piasau</i>, of
which they had been told by the Northern Indians,
and on the same day reached the mouth
of the Pekitanoni, the Indian name for the
rapid and turbulent Missouri. Inwardly resolving,
at some future time, to ascend its muddy
current, to cross the ridge beyond, and, descending
some river which falls into the Great
South sea (as the Pacific was then called), to
publish the gospel to all the people of the continent,
the zealous father passed onward toward
the south. Coasting slowly along the wasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
shore, lingering in the mouths of rivers, or exploring
dense forests in the hope of meeting the
natives, they continued on their course until
they reached the mouth of a river which they
called the <i>Ouabache</i>, or Wabash, none other
than the beautiful Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Here they found
the advanced settlement of Shawanese, who had
been pushed toward the southwest by the incessant
attacks of the Iroquois. But by this
time, fired with the hope of ascertaining the
outlet of the Mississippi, they postponed their
visit to these people until their return, and
floated on.</p>

<br />
<p>It is amusing, as well as instructive, to observe
how little importance the travellers gave to the
river Ohio, in their geographical assumptions.
In the map published by Marquette with his
&ldquo;Journal,&rdquo; the &ldquo;<i>Ouabisquigou</i>&rdquo; as he denominates
it, in euphonious French-Indian, compared
to the Illinois or even to the Wisconsin,
is but an inconsiderable rivulet! The lonely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
wanderers were much farther from the English
settlements than they supposed; a mistake into
which they must have been led, by hearing of
the incursions of the Iroquois; for even at that
early day they could not but know that the
head-waters of the Ohio were not distant from
the hunting-grounds of that warlike confederacy.
Even this explanation, however, scarcely
lessens our wonder that they should have known
so little of courses and distances; for had this
river been as short as it is here delineated, they
would have been within four hundred miles of
Montreal.</p>

<p>After leaving the Ohio, they suffered much
from the climate and its incidents; for they
were now approaching, in the middle of July,
a region of perpetual summer. Mosquitoes
and other venomous insects (in that region we
might even call them <i>ravenous</i> insects) became
intolerably annoying; and the <i>voyageurs</i> began
to think they had reached the country of the
terrible heats, which, as they had been warned
in the north, &ldquo;would wither them up like a dry
leaf.&rdquo; But the prospect of death by torture and
savage cruelty had not daunted them, and they
were not now disposed to be turned back by
any excess of climate. Arranging their sails
in the form of awnings to protect them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the sun by day and the dews by night, they
resolutely pursued their way.</p>

<p>Following the course of the river, they soon
entered the region of cane-brakes, so thick that
no animal larger than a cat could penetrate
them; and of cotton-wood forests of immense
size and of unparalleled density. They were
far beyond the limits of every Indian dialect
with which they had become acquainted&mdash;were,
in fact, approaching the region visited
by De Soto, on his famous expedition in search
of Juan Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
The country was possessed by the Sioux and
Chickasaws, to whom the <i>voyageurs</i> were total
strangers; but they went on without fear. In
the neighborhood of the southern boundary of
the present state of Arkansas, they were met
in hostile array by great numbers of the natives,
who approached them in large canoes
made from the trunks of hollow trees. But
Marquette held aloft the symbol of peace, the
ornamented calumet, and the hearts of the savages
were melted, as the pious father believed,
by the touch of God. They threw aside their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
weapons, and received the strangers with rude
but hearty hospitality. They escorted them,
with many demonstrations of welcome, to the
village of Michigamia; and, on the following
day, having feasted their strange guests plentifully,
though not with the unsavory meats of the
Illinois, they marched in triumphal procession
to the metropolis of Akansea, about ten leagues
distant, down the river.</p>

<br />
<p>This was the limit of their voyage. Here
they ascertained, beyond a doubt, that the Mississippi
flowed into the gulf of Mexico, and not,
as had been conjectured, into the great South
sea. Here they found the natives armed with
axes of steel, a proof of their traffic with the
Spaniards; and thus was the circle of discovery
complete, connecting the explorations of the
French with those of the Spanish, and entirely
enclosing the possessions of the English. No
voyage so important has since been undertaken&mdash;no
results so great have ever been
produced by so feeble an expedition. The
discoveries of Marquette, followed by the enterprises
of La Salle and his successors, have
influenced the destinies of nations; and passing
over all political speculations, this exploration
first threw open a valley of greater extent, fer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tility,
and commercial advantages, than any
other in the world. Had either the French or
the Spanish possessed the stubborn qualities
which <i>hold</i>, as they had the useful which <i>discover</i>,
the aspect of this continent would, at
this day, have been far different.</p>

<p>On the seventeenth of July, having preached
to the Indians the glory of God and the Catholic
faith, and proclaimed the power of the
<i>Grand Monarque</i>&mdash;for still we hear nothing
of speech-making or delivering credentials on
the part of Joliet&mdash;he set out on his return.
After severe and wasting toil for many days,
they reached a point, as Marquette supposed,
some leagues below the mouth of the Moingona,
or Des Moines. Here they left the Mississippi,
and crossed the country between that
river and the Illinois, probably passing through
the very country which now bears the good father's
name, entering the latter stream at a
point not far from the present town of Peoria.
Proceeding slowly up that calm river, preaching
to the tribes along its banks, and partaking
of their hospitality, he was at last conducted to
Lake Michigan, at Chicago, and by the end of
September was safe again in Green Bay, having
travelled, since the tenth of June, more than
three thousand miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>It might have been expected that one who
had made so magnificent a discovery&mdash;who
had braved so much and endured so much&mdash;would
wish to announce in person, to the authorities
in Canada, or in France, the results
of his expedition. Nay, it would not have
been unpardonable had he desired to enjoy,
after his labors, something of the consideration
to which their success entitled him. And, certainly,
no man could ever have approached his
rulers with a better claim upon their notice than
could the unpretending <i>voyageur</i>. But vainglory
was no more a part of his nature, than
was fear. The unaspiring priest remained at
Green Bay, to continue, or rather to resume, as
a task laid aside only for a time, his ministrations
to the savages. Joliet hastened on to
Quebec to report the expedition, and Marquette
returned to Chicago, for the purpose of
preaching the gospel to the Miami confederacy;
several allied tribes who occupied the country
between Lake Michigan and the Des Moines
river. Here again he visited the Illinois,
speaking to them of God, and of the religion
of Jesus; thus redeeming a promise which he
had made them, when on his expedition to the
South.</p>

<p>But his useful, unambitious life was drawing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to a close. Let us describe its last scene in the
words of our accomplished historian:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two years afterward, sailing from Chicago
to Mackinac, he entered a little river in Michigan.
Erecting an altar, he said mass, after the
rites of the Catholic church; then, begging the
men who conducted his canoe to leave him
alone for a half hour,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;'In the darkling wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offered to the mightiest solemn thanks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And supplication.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of the half hour they went to seek
him, <i>and he was no more</i>. The good missionary,
discoverer of a world, had fallen asleep on
the margin of the stream that bears his name.
Near its mouth, the canoe-men dug his grave
in the sand. Ever after, the forest rangers, in
their danger on Lake Michigan, would invoke
his name. The people of the West will build
his monument.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The monument is not yet built; though the
name of new counties in several of our western
states testifies that the noble missionary is not
altogether forgotten, in the land where he spent
so many self-denying years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the <i>voyageur</i> priest; the first, in
chronological order, of the succession of singular
men who have explored and peopled the
great West. And though many who have followed
him have been his equals in courage and
endurance, none have ever possessed the same
combination of heroic and unselfish qualities.
It ought not to be true that this brief and cursory
sketch is the first distinct tribute yet paid
to his virtues; for no worthier subject ever employed
the pen of the poet or historian.</p>

<div class="sidenoteb"><p><span class="smcap"><b>Note.</b></span>&mdash;Struck with the fact that the history of this class of
men, and of their enterprises and sufferings, has never been
written, except by themselves in their simple &ldquo;Journals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Relations&rdquo;&mdash;for the <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> given of these by Sparks, Bancroft,
and others, is of necessity a mere unsatisfactory abstract&mdash;the
writer has for some time been engaged in collecting and
arranging materials, with the intention of supplying the want.
The authorities are numerous and widely scattered; and such
a work ought to be thoroughly and carefully written, so that
much time and labor lies between the author and his day of
publication. Should he be spared, however, to finish the work,
he hopes to present a picture of a class of men, displaying as
much of true devotion, genuine courage, and self-denial, in the
humble walk of the missionary, as the pages of history show
in any other department of human enterprise.</p></div>

They are now quite obliterated.</p></div>

<p>Next, in chronological order, after the missionary,
came the military adventurer&mdash;of
which class La Salle was the best representative.
But the expeditions led by these men,
were, for the most part, wild and visionary enterprises,
in pursuit of unattainable ends. They
were, moreover, unskilfully managed and unfortunately
terminated&mdash;generally ending in
the defeat, disappointment, and death of those
who had set them on foot. They left no permanent
impress upon the country; the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>acute moral or political vision can not now detect
a trace of their influence, in the aspect of
the lands they penetrated; and, so far from
hastening the settlement of the Great Valley, it
is more probable that their disastrous failures
rather retarded it&mdash;by deterring others from
the undertaking. Their history reads like a
romance; and their characters would better
grace the pages of fiction, than the annals of
civilization. Further than this brief reference,
therefore, I find no place for them, in a work
which aims only to notice those who either aided
to produce, or indicated, the characteristics
of the society in which they lived.</p>

<span class="caption">THE PIONEER.</span></div>

<p>Soon after them, came the Indian-traders&mdash;to
whose generosity so many of the captives,
taken by the natives in those early times,
were indebted for their ransom. But&mdash;notwithstanding
occasional acts of charity&mdash;their
unscrupulous rapacity, and, particularly, their
introduction of spirituous liquors among the
savages, furnish good reason to doubt, whether,
on the whole, they did anything to advance the
civilization of the lands and people they visited.
And, as we shall have occasion to refer
again, though briefly, to the character in a subsequent
article, we will pass over it for the present,
and hasten on to the <i>Pioneer.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this class, there are two sub-divisions: the
floating, transitory, and erratic frontierman&mdash;including
the hunter, the trapper, the scout
and Indian-fighter: men who can not be considered
<i>citizens</i> of any country, but keep always a
little in advance of permanent emigration. With
this division of the class, we have little to do:
first, because they are already well understood,
by most readers in this country, through the
earlier novels of Cooper, their great delineator;
and, second, because, as we have intimated, our
business is chiefly with those, whose footprints
have been stamped upon the country, and
whose influence is traceable in its civilization.
We, therefore, now desire to direct attention to
the other sub-division&mdash;the genuine &ldquo;settler;&rdquo;
the firm, unflinching, permanent emigrant, who
entered the country to till the land and to possess
it, for himself and his descendants.</p>

<p>And, in the first place, let us inquire what
motives could induce men to leave regions,
where the axe had been at work for many
years&mdash;where the land was reduced to cultivation,
and the forest reclaimed from the wild
beast and the wilder savage&mdash;where civilization
had begun to exert its power, and society
had assumed a legal and determined shape&mdash;to
depart from all these things, seeking a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
home in an inhospitable wilderness, where they
could only gain a footing by severe labor, constant
strife, and sleepless vigilance? To be
capable of doing all this, from <i>any</i> motive, a
man must be a strange compound of qualities;
but that compound, strange as it is, has done,
and is doing, more to reclaim the west, and
change the wilderness into a garden, than all
other causes combined.</p>

<br />
<p>A prominent trait in the character of the
genuine American, is the desire &ldquo;to better his
condition&rdquo;&mdash;a peculiarity which sometimes
embodies itself in the disposition to forget the
good old maxim, &ldquo;Let well-enough alone,&rdquo; and
not unfrequently leads to disaster and suffering.
A thorough Yankee&mdash;using that word as
the English do, to indicate national, not sectional,
character&mdash;is never satisfied with doing
well; he always underrates his gains and his
successes; and, though to others he may be
boastful enough, and may, even truly, rate the
profits of his enterprise by long strings of
&ldquo;naught,&rdquo; he is always whispering to himself,
&ldquo;I ought to do better.&rdquo; If he sees any one
accumulating property faster than himself, he
becomes emulous and discontented&mdash;he is apt
to think, unless he goes more rapidly than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
one else, that he is not moving at all. If he
can find no one of his neighbors advancing
toward fortune, with longer strides than he, he
will imagine some successful &ldquo;speculator,&rdquo; to
whom he will compare himself, and chafe at
his inferiority to a figment of his own fancy.
If he possessed &ldquo;a million a minute,&rdquo; he would
cast about for some profitable employment, in
which he might engage, &ldquo;to pay expenses.&rdquo;
He will abandon a silver-mine, of slow, but certain
gains, for the gambling chances of a gold
&ldquo;placer;&rdquo; and if any one within his knowledge
dig out more wealth than he, he will leave the
&ldquo;diggings,&rdquo; though his success be quite encouraging,
and go quixoting among the islands
of the sea, in search of pearls and diamonds.
With the prospect of improvement in his fortunes&mdash;whether
that prospect be founded upon
reason, be a naked fancy, or the offspring of
mere discontent&mdash;he regards no danger, cares
for no hardship, counts no suffering. Everything
must bend before the ruling passion, &ldquo;to
better his condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His spirit is eminently encroaching. Rather
than give up any of his own &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; he will
take a part of what belongs to others. Whatever
he thinks necessary to his welfare, to that
he believes himself entitled. To whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
point he desires to reach, he takes the straightest
course, even though the way lie across the
corner of his neighbor's field. Yet he is intensely
jealous of his own possessions, and
warns off all trespassers with an imperial menace
of &ldquo;the utmost penalty of the law.&rdquo; He
has, of course, an excellent opinion of himself&mdash;and
justly: for when not blinded by cupidity
or vexed by opposition, no man can hold
the scales of justice with a more even hand.</p>

<p>He is seldom conscious of having done a
wrong: for he rarely moves until he has ascertained
&ldquo;both the propriety and expediency of
the motion.&rdquo; He has, therefore, an instinctive
aversion to all retractions and apologies. He
has such a proclivity to the forward movement,
that its opposite, even when truth and justice
demand it, is stigmatized, in his vocabulary,
by odious and ridiculous comparisons. He is
very stubborn, and, it is feared, sometimes mistakes
his obstinacy for firmness. He thinks a
safe retreat worse than a defeat with slaughter.
Yet he never rests under a reverse, and, though
manifestly prostrate, will never acknowledge
that he is beaten. A check enrages him more
than a decided failure: for so long as his end is
not accomplished, nor defeated, he can see no
reason why he should not succeed. If his forces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
are driven back, shattered and destroyed, he is
not cast down, but angry&mdash;he forthwith swears
vengeance and another trial. He is quite insatiable&mdash;as
a failure does not dampen him,
success can never satisfy him. His plans are
always on a great scale; and, if they sometimes
exceed his means of execution, at least, &ldquo;he
who aims at the sun,&rdquo; though he may lose his
arrow, &ldquo;will not strike the ground.&rdquo; He is a
great projector&mdash;but he is eminently practical,
as well as theoretical; and if <i>he</i> cannot
realize his visions, no other man need try.</p>

<p>He is restless and migratory. He is fond of
change, for the sake of the change; and he will
have it, though it bring him only new labors
and new hardships. He is, withal, a little selfish&mdash;as
might be supposed. He begins to
lose his attachment to the advantages of his
home, so soon as they are shared by others.
He does not like near neighbors&mdash;has no affection
for the soil; he will leave a place on which
he has expended much time and labor, as soon
as the region grows to be a &ldquo;settlement.&rdquo;
Even in a town, he is dissatisfied if his next
neighbor lives so near that the women can
gossip across the division-fence. He likes to
be at least one day's journey from the nearest
plantation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>I once heard an old pioneer assign as a reason
why he must emigrate from western Illinois,
the fact that &ldquo;people were settling right
under his nose&rdquo;&mdash;and the farm of his nearest
neighbor was twelve miles distant, by the section
lines! He moved on to Missouri, but there
the same &ldquo;impertinence&rdquo; of emigrants soon followed
him; and, abandoning his half-finished
&ldquo;clearing,&rdquo; he packed his family and household
goods in a little wagon, and retreated,
across the plains to Oregon. He is&mdash;or was,
two years ago&mdash;living in the valley of the
Willamette, where, doubtless, he is now chafing
under the affliction of having neighbors in
the same region, and nothing but an ocean beyond.</p>

<p>His character seems to be hard-featured.</p>

<p>But he is neither unsocial, nor morose. He
welcomes the stranger as heartily as the most
hospitable patriarch. He receives the sojourner
at his fireside without question. He regales
him with the best the house affords: is always
anxious to have him &ldquo;stay another day.&rdquo; He
cares for his horse, renews his harness, laughs
at his stories, and exchanges romances with him.
He hunts with him; fishes, rides, walks, talks,
eats, and drinks with him. His wife washes
and mends the stranger's shirts, and lends him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
a needle and thread to sew a button on his
only pair of pantaloons. The children sit on
his knee, the dog lies at his feet, and accompanies
him into the woods. The whole family
are his friends, and only grow cold and distant
when they learn that he is looking for land,
and thinks of &ldquo;settling&rdquo; within a few leagues.
If nothing of the sort occurs&mdash;and this only
&ldquo;leaks out&rdquo; by accident, for the pioneer never
pries inquisitively into the business of his guest,
he keeps him as long as he can; and when he
can stay no longer, fills his saddle-bags with
flitches of bacon and &ldquo;pones&rdquo; of corn-bread,
shakes him heartily by the hand, exacts a
promise to stop again on his return, and bids
him &ldquo;God-speed&rdquo; on his journey.</p>

<br />
<p>Such is American character, in the manifestations
which have most affected the settlement
and development of the West; a compound of
many noble qualities, with a few&mdash;and no nation
is without such&mdash;that are not quite so respectable.
All these, both good and bad, were
possessed by the early pioneer in an eminent,
sometimes in an extravagant degree; and the
circumstances, by which he found himself surrounded
after his emigration to the West,
tended forcibly to their exaggeration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>But the qualities&mdash;positive and negative&mdash;above
enumerated, were, many of them, at
least, peculiarities belonging to the early emigrant,
as much before as after his removal.
And there were others, quite as distinctly
marked, called into activity, if not actually
created by his life in the wilderness. Such,
for example, was his self-reliance&mdash;his confidence
in his own strength, sagacity, and courage.
It was but little assistance that he ever
required from his neighbors, though no man
was ever more willing to render it to others, in
the hour of need. He was the swift avenger
of his own wrongs, and he never appealed to
another to ascertain his rights. Legal tribunals
were an abomination to him. Government
functionaries he hated, almost as the Irish hate
excisemen. Assessments and taxes he could
not endure, for, since he was his own protector,
he had no interest in sustaining the civil authorities.</p>

<p>Military organizations he despised, for subordination
was no part of his nature. He stood
up in the native dignity of manhood, and called
no mortal his superior. When he joined his
neighbors, to avenge a foray of the savages, he
joined on the most equal terms&mdash;each man
was, for the time, his own captain; and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the leader was chosen&mdash;for the pioneers, with
all their personal independence, were far too
rational to underrate the advantages of a head
in the hour of danger&mdash;each voice was counted
in the choice, and the election might fall on
any one. But, even after such organization,
every man was fully at liberty to abandon the
expedition, whenever he became dissatisfied, or
thought proper to return home. And if this
want of discipline sometimes impaired the
strength, and rendered unavailing the efforts,
of communities, it at least fostered the manly
spirit of personal independence; and, to keep
that alive in the breasts of a people, it is worth
while to pay a yearly tribute, even though that
tribute be rendered unto the King of Terrors!</p>

<p>This self-reliance was not an arrogant and
vulgar egotism, as it has been so often represented
in western stories, and the tours of superficial
travellers. It was a calm, just estimate
of his own capabilities&mdash;a well-grounded confidence
in his own talents&mdash;a clear, manly
understanding of his own individual rights, dignity,
and relations. Such is the western definition
of independence; and if there be anything
of it in the western character at the present day,
it is due to the stubborn and intense individuality
of the first pioneer. He it was who laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the foundation of our social fabric, and it is his
spirit which yet pervades our people.</p>

<br />
<p>The quality which next appears, in analyzing
this character, is his <i>courage.</i></p>

<p>It was not mere physical courage, nor was it
stolid carelessness of danger. The pioneer
knew, perfectly well, the full extent of the
peril that surrounded him; indeed, he could
not be ignorant of it; for almost every day
brought some new memento, either of his savage
foe, or of the prowling beast of prey. He
ploughed, and sowed, and reaped, and gathered,
with the rifle slung over his shoulders; and, at
every turn, he halted, listening, with his ear
turned toward his home; for well he knew
that, any moment, the scream of his wife, or
the wail of his children, might tell of the up-lifted
tomahawk, or the murderous scalping-knife.</p>

<p>His courage, then, was not ignorance of danger&mdash;not
that of the child, which thrusts its
hand within the lion's jaws, and knows naught
of the penalty it braves. His ear was ever
listening, his eye was always watching, his
nerves were ever strung, for battle. He was
stout of heart, and strong of hand&mdash;he was
calm, sagacious, unterrified. He was never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
disconcerted&mdash;excitement seldom moved him&mdash;his
mind was always at its own command.
His heart never lost its firmness&mdash;no suffering
could overcome him&mdash;he was as stoical as the
savage, whose greatest glory is to triumph
amidst the most cruel tortures. His pride sustained
him when his flesh was pierced with
burning brands&mdash;when his muscles crisped
and crackled in the flames. To the force of
character, belonging to the white, he added the
savage virtues of the red man; and many a
captive has been rescued from the flames,
through his stern contempt for torture, and his
sneering triumph over his tormentors. The
highest virtue of the savage was his fortitude;
and he respected and admired even a &ldquo;pale
face,&rdquo; who emulated his endurance.</p>

<p>But fortitude is only passive courage&mdash;and
the bravery of the pioneer was eminently active.
His vengeance was as rapid as it was
sometimes cruel. No odds against him could
deter him, no time was ever wasted in deliberation.
If a depredation was committed in the
night, the dawn of morning found the sufferer
on the trail of the marauder. He would follow
it for days, and even weeks, with the sagacity
of the blood-hound, with the patience of the
savage: and, perhaps, in the very midst of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Indian country, in some moment of security,
the blow descended, and the injury was fearfully
avenged! The debt was never suffered
to accumulate, when it could be discharged by
prompt payment&mdash;and it was never forgotten!
If the account could not be balanced now, the
obligation was treasured up for a time to come&mdash;and,
when least expected, the debtor came,
and paid with usury!</p>

<br />
<p>It has been said, perhaps truly, that a fierce,
bloody spirit ruled the settlers in those early
days. And it is unquestionable, that much of
that contempt for the slow vengeance of a legal
proceeding, which now distinguishes the people
of the frontier west, originated then. It
was, doubtless, an unforgiving&mdash;eminently an
unchristian&mdash;spirit: but vengeance, sure and
swift, was the only thing which could impress
the hostile savage. And, if example, in a matter
of this sort, could be availing, for their
severity to the Indians, they had the highest!</p>

<p>The eastern colonists&mdash;good men and true&mdash;&ldquo;willing
to exterminate the savages,&rdquo; says
Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> who is certainly not their enemy,
offered a bounty for every Indian scalp&mdash;as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
we, in the west, do for the scalps of wolves!
&ldquo;To regular forces under pay, the grant was
<i>ten</i> pounds&mdash;to volunteers, in actual service,
<i>twice that sum</i>; but if men would, of themselves,
without pay, make up parties and patrol
the forests in search of Indians, <i>as of old the
woods were scoured for wild beasts</i>, the chase
was invigorated by the promised 'encouragement
of <i>fifty</i> pounds per scalp!'&rdquo; The &ldquo;fruitless
cruelties&rdquo; of the Indian allies of the French
in Canada, says the historian, gave birth to these
humane and nicely-graduated enactments! Nor
is our admiration of their Christian spirit in the
least diminished, when we reflect that nothing
is recorded in history of &ldquo;bounties on scalps&rdquo;
or &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; to murder, offered by
Frontenac, or any other French-Canadian governor,
as a revenge for the horrible massacre at
Montreal, or the many &ldquo;fruitless cruelties&rdquo; of
the bloody Iroquois!<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The descendants of the men who gave these
&ldquo;bounties&rdquo; and &ldquo;encouragements,&rdquo; have, in our
own day, caressed, and wept and lamented over
the tawny murderer, Black-Hawk, and his
&ldquo;wrongs&rdquo; and &ldquo;misfortunes;&rdquo; but the theatre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of Indian warfare was then removed a little
farther west; and the atrocities of Haverhill
and Deerfield were perpetrated on the western
prairies, and not amid the forests of the east!
Yet I do not mean, by referring to this passage
of history&mdash;or to the rivers of wasted sentiment
poured out a few years ago&mdash;so much to
condemn our forefathers, or to draw invidious
comparisons between them and others, as to
show, that the war of extermination, sometimes
waged by western rangers, was not without example&mdash;that
the cruelty and hatred of the pioneer
to the barbarous Indian, might originate
in exasperation, which even moved the puritans;
and that the lamentations, over the fictitious
&ldquo;wrongs&rdquo; of a turbulent and bloody savage,
might have run in a channel nearer home.</p>

<br />
<p>Hatred of the Indian, among the pioneers,
was hereditary; there was scarcely a man on
the frontier, who had not lost a father, a mother,
or a brother, by the tomahawk; and not a
few of them had suffered in their own persons.
The child, who learned the rudiments of his
scanty education at his mother's knee, must
decipher the strange characters by the straggling
light which penetrated the crevices between
the logs; for, while the father was ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>sent,
in the field or on the war-path, the mother
was obliged to bar the doors and barricade the
windows against the savages. Thus, if he did
not literally imbibe it with his mother's milk,
one of the first things the pioneer learned, was
dread, and consequently hatred, of the Indian.
That feeling grew with his growth, strengthened
with his strength&mdash;for a life upon the
western border left but few days free from
sights of blood or mementoes of the savage. The
pioneer might go to the field in the morning,
unsuspecting; and, at noon, returning, find his
wife murdered and scalped, and the brains of
his little ones dashed out against his own doorpost!
And if a deadly hatred of the Indian
took possession of his heart, who shall blame
him? It may be said, the pioneer was an intruder,
seeking to take forcible possession of the
Indian's lands&mdash;and that it was natural that
the Indian should resent the wrong after the
manner of his race. Granted: and it was quite
as natural that the pioneer should return the
enmity, after the manner of <i>his</i> race!</p>

<p>But the pioneer was <i>not</i> an intruder.</p>

<p>For all the purposes, for which reason and the
order of Providence authorize us to say, God
made the earth, this continent was vacant&mdash;uninhabited.
And&mdash;granting that the savage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was in possession&mdash;for this is his only ground
of title, as, indeed, it is the foundation of all
primary title&mdash;there were at the period of the
first landing of white men on the continent, between
Lake Superior and the Gulf of Mexico,
east of the Mississippi, about one hundred and
eighty thousand Indians.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> That region now
supports at least twenty millions of civilized
people, and is capable of containing quite ten
times that number, without crowding! Now,
if God made the earth for any purpose, it certainly
was <i>not</i> that it should be monopolized by
a horde of nomad savages!</p>

<p>But an argument on this subject, would not
be worth ink and paper; and I am, moreover,
aware, that this reasoning may be abused.
<i>Any</i> attempt to construe the purposes of Deity
must be liable to the same misapplication.
And, besides, it is not my design to go so
far back; I seek not so much to excuse as to account
for&mdash;less to justify than to analyze&mdash;the
characteristics of the class before me. I wish
to establish that the pioneer hatred of the Indian
was not an unprovoked or groundless
hatred, that the severity of his warfare was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a mere gratuitous and bloody-minded cruelty.
There are a thousand actions, of which we
are hearing every day, that are indefensible in
morals: and yet we are conscious while we
condemn the actors, that, in like circumstances,
we could not have acted differently. So is it
with the fierce and violent reprisals, sometimes
made by frontier rangers. Their best defence
lies in the statement that they were men, and
that their manhood prompted them to vengeance.
When they deemed themselves injured,
they demanded reparation, in such sort
as that demand could then be made&mdash;at the
muzzle of a rifle or the point of a knife. They
were equal to the times in which they lived.&mdash;Had
they not been so, how many steamboats
would now be floating on the Mississippi?</p>

<br />
<p>There was no romance in the composition of
the pioneer&mdash;whatever there may have been
in his environment. His life was altogether
too serious a matter for poetry, and the only
music he took pleasure in, was the sound of a
violin, sending forth notes remarkable only for
their liveliness. Even this, he could enjoy but
at rare periods, when his cares were forcibly
dismissed. He was, in truth, a very matter-of-fact
sort of person. It was principally with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
facts that he had to deal&mdash;and most of them
were very &ldquo;stubborn facts.&rdquo; Indeed, it may
be doubted&mdash;notwithstanding much good poetry
has been written (in cities chiefly), on solitude
and the wilderness&mdash;whether a life in the
woods is, after all, very suggestive of poetical
thoughts. The perils of the frontier must borrow
most of their &ldquo;enchantment&rdquo; from the
&ldquo;distance;&rdquo; and its sufferings and hardships
are certainly more likely to evoke pleasant
fancies to him who sits beside a good coal fire,
than to one whose lot it is to bear them. Even
the (so-called) &ldquo;varied imagery&rdquo; of the Indian's
eloquence&mdash;about which so much nonsense
has been written&mdash;is, in a far greater measure,
the result of the poverty and crude materialism
of his language, than of any poetical bias, temperament,
or tone of thought. An Indian, as
we have said before, has no humor&mdash;he never
understands a jest&mdash;his wife is a beast of burthen&mdash;heaven
is a hunting-ground&mdash;his language
has no words to express abstract qualities,
virtues, or sentiments. And yet he lives
in the wilderness all the days of his life! The
only trait he has, in common with the poetical
character, is his laziness.</p>

<p>But the pioneer was not indolent, in any
sense. He had no dreaminess&mdash;meditation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was no part of his mental habit&mdash;a poetical
fancy would, in him, have been an indication
of insanity. If he reclined at the foot of a tree,
on a still summer day, it was to sleep: if he
gazed out over the waving prairie, it was to
search for the column of smoke which told of
his enemy's approach: if he turned his eyes
toward the blue heaven, it was to prognosticate
to-morrow's storm or sunshine: if he bent his
gaze upon the green earth, it was to look for
&ldquo;Indian sign&rdquo; or buffalo trail. His wife was only
a help-mate&mdash;he never thought of making a divinity
of her&mdash;she cooked his dinner, made
and washed his clothes, bore his children, and
took care of his household. His children were
never &ldquo;little cherubs,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;angels sent from
heaven&rdquo;&mdash;but generally &ldquo;tow-headed&rdquo; and
very earthly responsibilities. He looked forward
anxiously, to the day when the boys
should be able to assist him in the field, or fight
the Indian, and the girls to help their mother
make and mend. When one of the latter took
it into her head to be married&mdash;as they usually
did quite early in life; for beaux were plenty
and belles were &ldquo;scarce&rdquo;&mdash;he only made one
condition, that the man of her choice should be
brave and healthy. He never made a &ldquo;parade&rdquo;
about anything&mdash;marriage, least of all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
He usually gave the bride&mdash;not the &ldquo;blushing&rdquo;
bride&mdash;a bed, a lean horse, and some
good advice: and, having thus discharged his
duty in the premises, returned to his work, and
the business was done.</p>

<br />
<p>The marriage ceremony, in those days, was a
very unceremonious affair. The parade and
drill which now attend it, would then have
been as ridiculous as a Chinese dance; and the
finery and ornament, at present understood to
be indispensable on such occasions, then bore
no sway in fashion. Bridal wreaths and dresses
were not known; and white kid gloves and
satin slippers never heard of. Orange blossoms&mdash;natural
and artificial&mdash;were as pretty then
as now; but the people were more occupied
with substance, than with emblem.</p>

<br />
<p>The ancients decked <i>their</i> victims for the
sacrifice with gaudy colors, flags, and streamers;
the moderns do the same, and the offerings
are sometimes made to quite as barbarous
deities.</p>

<p>But the bride of the pioneer was clothed in
linsey-wolsey, with hose of woollen yarn; and
moccasins of deer-skin&mdash;or as an extra piece
of finery, high-quartered shoes of calf-skin&mdash;pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ceded
satin slippers. The bridegroom came in
copperas-colored jeans&mdash;domestic manufacture&mdash;as
a holiday suit; or, perhaps, a hunting-shirt
of buckskin, all fringed around the skirt
and cape, and a &ldquo;coon-skin&rdquo; cap, with moccasins.
Instead of a dainty walking-stick, with
an opera-dancer's leg, in ivory, for head, he always
brought his rifle, with a solid maple stock;
and never, during the whole ceremony, did he
divest himself of powder-horn and bullet-pouch.</p>

<p>Protestant ministers of the gospel were few
in those days; and the words of form were
usually spoken by a Jesuit missionary. Or, if
the Pioneer had objections to Catholicism&mdash;as
many had&mdash;his place was supplied by some
justice of the peace, of doubtful powers and
mythical appointment. If neither of these
could be procured, the father of the bride, himself,
sometimes assumed the functions, <i>pro h&acirc;c
vice</i>, or <i>pro tempore</i>, of minister or justice. It
was always understood, however, that such
left-handed marriages were to be confirmed by
the first minister who wandered to the frontier:
and, even when the opportunity did not offer
for many months, no scandal ever arose&mdash;the
marriage vow was never broken. The pioneers
were simple people&mdash;the refinements of high
cultivation had not yet penetrated the forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
or crossed the prairies&mdash;and good faith and
virtue were as common as courage and sagacity.</p>

<br />
<p>When the brief, but all-sufficient ceremony
was over, the bridegroom resumed his rifle,
helped the bride into the saddle&mdash;or more frequently
to the pillion behind him&mdash;and they
calmly rode away together.</p>

<br />
<p>On some pleasant spot&mdash;surrounded by a
shady grove, or point of timber&mdash;a new log-cabin
has been built: its rough logs notched across
each other at the corners, a roof of oaken clapboards,
held firmly down by long poles along
each course, its floor of heavy &ldquo;puncheons,&rdquo; its
broad, cheerful fireplace, large as a modern
bed-room&mdash;all are in the highest style of frontier
architecture. Within&mdash;excepting some
anomalies, such as putting the skillet and tea-kettle
in the little cupboard, along with the
blue-edged plates and yellow-figured tea-cups&mdash;for
the whole has been arranged by the
hands of the bridegroom himself&mdash;everything
is neatly and properly disposed. The oaken
bedstead, with low square posts, stands in one
corner, and the bed is covered by a pure white
counterpane, with fringe&mdash;an heirloom in the
family of the bride. At the foot of this is seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
a large, heavy chest&mdash;like a camp-chest&mdash;to
serve for bureau, safe, and dressing-case.</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor&mdash;directly above a
trap-door which leads to a &ldquo;potato-hole&rdquo; beneath&mdash;stands
a ponderous walnut table, and
on it sits a nest of wooden trays; while, flanking
these, on one side, is a nicely-folded tablecloth,
and, on the other, a wooden-handled
butcher-knife and a well-worn Bible. Around
the room are ranged a few &ldquo;split-bottomed&rdquo;
chairs, exclusively for use, not ornament. In
the chimney-corners, or under the table, are
several three-legged stools, made for the children,
who&mdash;as the bridegroom laughingly insinuates
while he points to the uncouth specimens
of his handiwork&mdash;&ldquo;will be coming in
due time.&rdquo; The wife laughs in her turn&mdash;replies,
&ldquo;no doubt&rdquo;&mdash;and, taking one of the graceful
tripods in her hand, carries it forth to sit upon
while she milks the cow&mdash;for she understands
what she is expected to do, and does it without
delay. In one corner&mdash;near the fireplace&mdash;the
aforesaid cupboard is erected&mdash;being a
few oaken shelves neatly pinned to the logs
with hickory forks&mdash;and in this are arranged
the plates and cups;&mdash;not as the honest pride
of the housewife would arrange them, to display
them to the best advantage&mdash;but piled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
away, one within another, without reference to
show. As yet there is no sign of female taste
or presence.</p>

<br />
<p>But now the house receives its mistress. The
&ldquo;happy couple&rdquo; ride up to the low rail-fence
in front&mdash;the bride springs off without assistance,
affectation, or delay. The husband leads
away the horse or horses, and the wife enters
the dominion, where, thenceforward, she is
queen. There is no coyness, no blushing, no
pretence of fright or nervousness&mdash;if you will,
no romance&mdash;for which the husband has reason
to be thankful! The wife knows what her
duties are and resolutely goes about performing
them. She never dreamed, nor twaddled, about
&ldquo;love in a cottage,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the sweet communion
of congenial souls&rdquo; (who never eat anything):
and she is, therefore, not disappointed on discovering
that life is actually a serious thing.
She never whines about &ldquo;making her husband
happy&rdquo;&mdash;but sets firmly and sensibly about
making him <i>comfortable</i>. She cooks his dinner,
nurses his children, shares his hardships,
and encourages his industry. She never complains
of having too much work to do, she does
not desert her home to make endless visits&mdash;she
borrows no misfortunes, has no imaginary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
ailings. Milliners and mantua-makers she ignores&mdash;&ldquo;shopping&rdquo;
she never heard of&mdash;scandal
she never invents or listens to. She never
wishes for fine carriages, professes no inability
to walk five hundred yards, and does not think
it a &ldquo;vulgar accomplishment,&rdquo; to know how to
make butter. She has no groundless anxieties,
she is not nervous about her children taking
cold: a doctor is a visionary potentate to her&mdash;a
drug-shop is a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of abominations. She
never forgets whose wife she is,&mdash;there is no
&ldquo;sweet confidante&rdquo; without whom she &ldquo;can not
live&rdquo;&mdash;she never writes endless letters about
nothing. She is, in short, a faithful, honest
wife: and, &ldquo;in due time,&rdquo; the husband must
make <i>more</i> &ldquo;three-legged stools&rdquo;&mdash;for the &ldquo;tow-heads&rdquo;
have now covered them all!</p>

<br />
<p>Such is the wife and mother of the pioneer,
and, with such influences about him, how could
he be otherwise than honest, straightforward,
and manly?</p>

<br />
<p>But, though a life in the woods was an enemy
to every sort of sentimentalism&mdash;though a more
unromantic being than the pioneer can hardly
be imagined&mdash;yet his character unquestionably
took its hue, from the primitive scenes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
events of his solitary existence. He was, in
many things, as simple as a child: as credulous,
as unsophisticated. Yet the utmost cunning of
the wily savage&mdash;all the strategy of Indian
warfare&mdash;was not sufficient to deceive or overreach
him! Though one might have expected
that his life of ceaseless watchfulness would
make him skeptical and suspicious, his confidence
was given heartily, without reservation,
and often most imprudently. If he gave his
trust at all, you might ply him, by the hour,
with the most improbable and outrageous fictions,
without fear of contradiction or of unbelief.
He never questioned the superior
knowledge or pretensions of any one who
claimed acquaintance with subjects of which
<i>he</i> was ignorant.</p>

<p>The character of his intellect, like that of the
Indian, was thoroughly synthetical: he had
nothing of the faculty which enables us to detect
falsehood, even in matters of which we
know nothing by comparison and analogy. He
never analyzed any story told him, he took it
as a unit; and, unless it violated some known
principle of his experience, or conflicted with
some fact of his own observation, never doubted
its truth. At this moment, there are men in
every western settlement who have only vague,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
crude notions of what a city is&mdash;who would
feel nervous if they stepped upon the deck of a
steamboat&mdash;and are utterly at a loss to conjecture
the nature of a railroad. Upon either of
these mystical subjects they will swallow, without
straining, the most absurd and impossible
fictions. And this is not because of their ignorance
alone, for many of them are, for their
sphere in life, educated, intelligent, and, what is
better, sensible men. Nor is it by any means
a national trait: for a genuine Yankee will
scarcely believe the truth; and, though he may
sometimes trust in very wild things, his faith is
usually an active &ldquo;craze,&rdquo; and not mere passive
credulity. The pioneer, then, has not derived it
from his eastern fathers: it is the growth of the
woods and prairies&mdash;an embellishment to a
character which might otherwise appear naked
and severe.</p>

<br />
<p>Another characteristic, traceable to the same
source, the stern reality of his life, is the pioneer's
gravity.</p>

<p>The agricultural population of this country
are, at the best, not a cheerful race. Though
they sometimes join in festivities, it is but
seldom; and the wildness of their dissipation is
too often in proportion to its infrequency. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
is none of the serene contentment&mdash;none of
that smiling enjoyment&mdash;which, according to
travellers like Howitt, distinguishes the tillers
of the ground in other lands. <i>Sedateness</i> is a
national characteristic, but the gravity of the
pioneer is quite another thing; it includes
pride and personal dignity, and indicates a
stern, unyielding temper. There is, however,
nothing morose in it: it is its aspect alone,
which forbids approach; and that only makes
more conspicuous the heartiness of your reception,
when once the shell is broken. Acquainted
with the character, you do not expect him to
<i>smile</i> much; but now and then he <i>laughs</i>: and
that laugh is round, free, and hearty. You
know at once that he enjoys it, you are convinced
that he is a firm friend and &ldquo;a good
hater.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>It is not surprising, with a character such as
I have described, that the pioneer is not gregarious,
that he is, indeed, rather solitary. Accordingly,
we never find a genuine specimen of
the class, among the emigrants, who come in
shoals and flocks, and pitch their tents in &ldquo;colonies;&rdquo;
who lay out towns and cities, projected
upon paper, and call them New Boston, New
Albany, or New Hartford, before one log is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
placed upon another; nor are there many of the
unadulterated stock among that other class, who
come from regions further south, and christen
their towns, classically, Carthage, Rome, or
Athens: or, patriotically, in commemoration of
some Virginian worthy, some Maryland sharpshooter,
or &ldquo;Jersey blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The real pioneer never emigrates gregariously;
he does not wish to be within &ldquo;halloo&rdquo; of
his nearest neighbor; he is no city-builder; and,
if he does project a town, he christens it by
some such name as Boonville or Clarksville, in
memory of a noted pioneer: or Jacksonville or
Waynesville, to commemorate some &ldquo;old hero&rdquo;
who was celebrated for good fighting.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> And
the reason why the outlandish and <i>outr&eacute;</i> so much
predominate in the names of western towns
and cities, must be sought in the fact referred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to above, that the western man is not essentially
a town-projector, and that, consequently, comparatively
few of the towns were &ldquo;laid out&rdquo; by
the legitimate pioneer. We shall have more to
say of town-building under another head; and,
in the meantime, having said that the pioneer
is not gregarious, let us look at the <i>manner</i> of
his emigration.</p>

<br />
<p>Many a time, in the western highways, have
I met with the sturdy &ldquo;mover,&rdquo; as he is called,
in the places where people are stationary&mdash;a
family, sometimes by no means small, wandering
toward the setting sun, in search of
pleasant places on the lands of &ldquo;Uncle Sam.&rdquo;
Many a time, in the forest or on the prairie&mdash;generally
upon some point of timber which puts
a mile or two within the plain&mdash;have I passed
the &ldquo;clearing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pre-emption,&rdquo; where, with
nervous arm and sturdy heart, the &ldquo;squatter&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
cleaves out, and renders habitable, a home for
himself and a heritage for his children.</p>

<p>Upon the road, you first meet the pioneer him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>self,
for he almost always walks a few hundred
yards ahead. He is usually above the medium
height, and rather spare. He stoops a little,
too; for he has done a deal of hard work, and
expects to do more; but you see at once, that
unless his lungs are weak, his strength is by no
means broken, and you are quite sure that many
a stately tree is destined to be humbled by his
sinewy arm. He is attired in frontier fashion:
he wears a loose coat, called a hunting-shirt, of
jeans or linsey, and its color is that indescribable
hue compounded of copperas and madder;
pantaloons, exceedingly loose, and not very accurately
cut in any part, of like color and
material, defend his lower limbs. His feet are
cased in low, fox-colored shoes, for of boots, he
is, yet, quite innocent. Around his throat and
wrists, even in midsummer, you see the collar
and wristbands of a heavy, deep-red, flannel-shirt.
Examine him very closely, and you will
probably find no other garment on his person.</p>

<p>His hair is dark, and not very evenly trimmed&mdash;for
his wife or daughter has performed
the tonsure with a pair of rusty shears; and the
longer locks seem changed in hue, as if his
dingy wool hat did not sufficiently protect them
against the wind and rain. Over his shoulder
he carries a heavy rifle, heavier than a &ldquo;Har<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>per's
ferry musket,&rdquo; running about &ldquo;fifty to the
pound.&rdquo; Around his neck are swung the
powder-horn and bullet-pouch, the former protected
by a square of deer-skin, and the latter
ornamented with a squirrel's tail.</p>

<p>You take note of all these things, and then
recur to his melancholy-looking face, with its
mild blue eyes and sharpened features. You
think he looks thin, and conjecture that his chest
may be weak, or his lungs affected, by the stoop
in his shoulders; but when he lifts his eyes, and
asks the way to Thompson's ferry, or how far it
is to water, you are satisfied: for the glance of
his eye is calm and firm, and the tone of his
voice is round and healthy. You answer his
question, he nods quietly by way of thanks, and
marches on; and, though you draw your rein,
and seem inclined to further converse, he takes
no notice, and pursues his way.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterward, you meet the family.
A small, light wagon, easily dragged through
sloughs and heavy roads, is covered with a white
cotton cloth, and drawn, by either two yokes of
oxen, or a pair of lean horses. A &ldquo;patch-work&rdquo;
quilt is sometimes stretched across the flimsy
covering, as a guard against the sun and rain.
Within this vehicle are stowed all the emigrant's
household goods, and still, it is not overloaded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>There is usually a large chest, containing the
wardrobe of the family, with such small articles
as are liable to loss, and the little store of money.
This is always in silver, for the pioneer is no
judge of gold, and, on the frontier, paper has
but little exchangeable value. There are then
two light bedsteads&mdash;one &ldquo;a trundle-bed&rdquo;&mdash;a
few plain chairs, most of them tied on behind
and at the sides; three or four stools, domestic
manufacture; a set of tent-poles and a few pots
and pans. On these are piled the &ldquo;beds and
bedding,&rdquo; tied in large bundles, and stowed in
such manner as to make convenient room for the
children who are too young to walk. In the
front end of the wagon, sits the mother of the
family: and, peering over her head and shoulders,
leaning out at her side, or gazing under
the edge of the cotton-covering, are numerous
flaxen heads, which you find it difficult to count
while you ride past.</p>

<br />
<p>There are altogether too many of them, you
think, for a man no older than the one you met,
a while ago; and you, perhaps, conjecture that
the youthful-looking woman has adopted some
of her dead sister's children, or, perchance, some
of her brothers and sisters themselves. But
you are mistaken, they are all her offspring, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the father of every one of them is the stoop-shouldered
man you saw ahead. If you look
closely, you will observe that the mother, who
is driving, holds the reins with one hand, while,
on the other arm, she supports an infant not
<i>more</i> than six months old. It was for the advent
of this little stranger, that they delayed their
emigration: and they set out while it was very
young, for fear of the approach of its successor.
If they waited for their youngest child to attain
a year of age, they would never &ldquo;move,&rdquo;
until they would be too old to make another
&ldquo;clearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You pass on&mdash;perhaps ejaculating thanks
that your lot has been differently cast, and
thinking you have seen the last of them.
But a few hundred yards further, and you hear
the tinkling of a bell; two or three lean cows&mdash;with
calves about the age of the baby&mdash;come
straggling by. You look for the driver,
and see a tall girl with a very young face&mdash;the
eldest of the family, though not exceeding
twelve or thirteen years in age. You feel quite
sure, that, besides her sun-bonnet and well-worn
shoes, she wears but one article of apparel&mdash;and
that a loose dress of linsey, rather
narrow in the skirt, of a dirty brown color, with
a tinge of red. It hangs straight down about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
her limbs, as if it were wet, and with every
step&mdash;for she walks stoutly&mdash;it flaps and flies
about her ankles, as if shotted in the lower hem.
She presents, altogether, rather a slatternly
figure, and her face is freckled and sunburnt.</p>

<p>But you must not judge her too rashly; for
her eye is keen and expressive, and her mouth
is quite pretty&mdash;especially when she smiles.
A few years hence&mdash;if you have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>&mdash;you
may meet her in the best and highest circles
of the country. Perhaps, while you are
dancing attendance upon some new administration,
asking for a &ldquo;place,&rdquo; and asking, probably,
in vain, she may come to Washington, a
beautiful and accomplished woman&mdash;the wife
of some member of Congress, whose constituency
is numbered by the hundred thousand!</p>

<p>You may pass on, now, and forget her; but,
if you stop to talk five minutes, she will not
forget <i>you</i>&mdash;at least, if you say anything striking
or sensible. And when you meet her again,
perhaps in a gilded saloon, among the brightest
and highest in the land&mdash;if you seek an introduction,
as you probably will&mdash;she will remind
you of the meeting, and to your astonishment,
will laughingly describe the scene, to some of
her obsequious friends who stand around. And
then she will perhaps introduce you, as an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
friend, to one of those flax-haired boys, who
peeped out of the wagon over his mother's
shoulder, as you passed them in the wilderness:
and you recognise one of the members from
California, or from Oregon, whose influence in
the house, though he is as yet a very young man,
is already quite considerable. If you are successful
in your application for a &ldquo;place,&rdquo; it
may be that the casual meeting in the forest or
on the prairie was the seed which, germinating
through long years of obscurity, finally sprung
up <i>thus</i>, and bore a crop of high official honors!</p>

<p>The next time you meet a family of emigrants
on the frontier, you will probably observe them
a little more closely.</p>

<p>Not a few of those who bear a prominent
part in the government of our country&mdash;more
than one of the first men of the nation&mdash;men
whose names are now heard in connection with
the highest office of the people&mdash;twenty years
ago, occupied a place as humble in the scale of
influence, as that flaxen-haired son of the stoop-shouldered
emigrant. Such are the elements
of our civilization&mdash;such the spirit of our institutions!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
We have hitherto been speaking only of the
American pioneer, and we have devoted more
space to him, than we shall give to his contemporaries,
because he has exerted more influence,
both in the settlement of the country, and in
the formation of sectional character and social
peculiarities, than all the rest combined.</p>

<p>The French emigrant was quite a different
being. Even at this day, there are no two
classes&mdash;not the eastern and western, or the
northern and southern&mdash;between whom the
distinction is more marked, than it has always
been between the Saxon and the Frank. The
advent of the latter was much earlier than that
of the former; and to him, therefore, must be
ascribed the credit of the first settlement of the
country. But, for all purposes of lasting impression,
he must yield to his successor. It
was, in fact, the American who penetrated and
cleared the forest&mdash;who subdued and drove out
the Indian&mdash;who, in a word, reclaimed the
country.</p>

<br />
<p>In nothing was the distinction between the
two races broader, than in the feelings with
which they approached the savage. We have
seen that the hatred, borne by the American
toward his red enemy, was to be traced to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
long series of mutual hostilities and wrongs.
But the Frenchman had no such injuries to
avenge, no hereditary feud to prosecute. The
first of his nation who had entered the country
were non-combatants&mdash;they came to convert
the savage, not to conquer him, or deprive him
of his lands. Even as early as sixteen hundred
and eight, the Jesuits had established friendly
relations with the Indians of Canada&mdash;and before
the stern crew of the May Flower had landed
on Plymouth Rock, they had preached the
gospel on the shores of Lake Huron. Their
piety and wisdom had acquired an influence
over the untutored Indian, long before the commencement
of the hostilities, which afterward
cost so much blood and suffering. They had,
thus, smoothed the way for their countrymen,
and opened a safe path through the wilderness,
to the shore of the great western waters. And
the people who followed and accompanied them,
were peculiarly adapted to improve the advantages
thus given them.</p>

<p>They were a gentle, peaceful, unambitious
people. They came as the friend, not the hereditary
enemy, of the savage. They tendered
the calumet&mdash;a symbol well understood by
every Indian&mdash;and were received as allies and
brethren. They had no national prejudices to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
overcome: the copper color of the Indian was
not an insuperable objection to intermarriage,
and children of the mixed blood were not, for
that reason, objects of scorn. An Indian
maiden was as much a woman to a Frenchman,
as if she had been a <i>blonde</i>; and, if her form
was graceful and her features comely, he would
woo her with as much ardor as if she had been
one of his own race.</p>

<p>Nor was this peculiarity attributable only to
the native gallantry of the French character,
as it has sometimes been asserted; the total
want of prejudice, which grows up in contemplating
an inferior race, held in limited subjection,
and a certain easiness of temper and tone
of thought, had far more influence.</p>

<p>The Frenchman has quite enough vanity,
but very little pride. Whatever, therefore, is
sanctioned by those who surrounded him, is, in
his eyes, no degradation. He married the Indian
woman&mdash;first, because there were but few
females among the emigrants, and he could not
live without &ldquo;the sex;&rdquo; and, second, because
there was nothing in his prejudices, or in public
sentiment, to deter him. The descendants
of these marriages&mdash;except where, as in some
cases, they are upheld by the possession of
great wealth&mdash;have no consideration, and are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
seldom seen in the society of the whites. But
this is only because French manners and feelings
have long since faded out of our social organization.
The Saxon, with his unconquerable
prejudices of race, with his pride and jealousy,
has taken possession of the country; and,
as he rules its political destinies, in most places,
likewise, gives tones to its manners. Had
Frenchmen continued to possess the land&mdash;had
French dominion not given place to English&mdash;mixture
of blood would have had but little influence
on one's position; and there would now
have been, in St. Louis or Chicago, as many
shades of color in a social assembly, as may be
seen at a ball in Mexico.</p>

<br />
<p>The French are a more cheerful people, than
the Americans. Social intercourse&mdash;the interchange
of hospitalities&mdash;the enjoyment of
amusements in crowds&mdash;are far more important
to them than to any other race. Solitude
and misery are&mdash;or ought to be&mdash;synonyms
in French; and enjoyment is like glory&mdash;it
must have witnesses, or it will lose its attraction.
Accordingly, we find the French emigrant
seeking companionship, even in the trials
and enterprises of the wilderness. The American,
after the manner of his race, sought places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
where he could possess, for himself, enough for
his wants, and be &ldquo;monarch of all he surveyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Frenchman had no such pride. He
resorted to a town, where the amusements of
dancing, <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, and social converse, were to be
found&mdash;where the narrow streets were scarcely
more than a division fence, &ldquo;across which the
women could carry on their voluble conversations,
without leaving their homes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This
must have been a great advantage, and probably
contributed, in no slight degree, to the
singular peace of their villages&mdash;since the
proximity afforded no temptation to going
abroad, and the distance was yet too great to
allow such whisperings and scandal, as usually
break up the harmony of small circles. Whether
the fact is to be attributed to this, or to some
other cause, certain it is that these little communities
were eminently peaceful. From the
first settlement of Kaskaskia, for example, down
to the transfer of the western country to the
British&mdash;almost a century&mdash;I find no record,
even in the voluminous epistolary chronicles,
of any personal rencontre, or serious quarrel,
among the inhabitants. The same praise can
not be given to any American town ever yet
built.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>A species of communism seems to be a portion
of the French character; for we discover,
that, even at that early day, <i>paysans</i>, or <i>habitans</i>,
collected together in villages, had their
<i>common fields</i>, where the separate portion of
each family was still a part of the common
stock&mdash;and their tract of pasture-land, where
there was no division, or separate property.
One enclosure covered all the fields of the community,
and all submitted to regulations made
by the free voice of the people.</p>

<p>If one was sick, or employed in the service
of the colony, or absent on business of his own
at planting or harvest time, his portion was not
therefore neglected: his ground was planted,
or his crop was gathered, by the associated
labor of his neighbors, as thoroughly and carefully
as if he had been at home. His family
had nothing to fear; because in the social code
of the simple villagers, each was as much bound
to maintain the children of his friend as his
own. This state of things might have its inconveniences
and vices&mdash;of which, perhaps,
the worst was its tendency to merge the family
into the community, and thus&mdash;by obliterating
the lines of individuality and personal independence&mdash;benumbing
enterprise and checking
improvements: but it was certainly produc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>tive
of some good results, also. It tended to
make people careful each of the other's rights,
kind to the afflicted, and brotherly in their
social intercourse. The attractive simplicity
of manners observable, even at this day, in
some of the old French villages, is traceable to
this peculiar form of their early organization.</p>

<p>It would be well if that primitive simplicity
of life and manners, could be combined with
rapid, or even moderate improvement. But,
in the present state of the world, this can
scarcely be; and, accordingly, we find the
Frenchman of the passing year, differing but
little from his ancestor of sixteen hundred and
fifty&mdash;still living in the old patriarchal style,
still cultivating his share of the common field,
and still using the antiquated processes of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<br />
<p>But, though not so active as their neighbors,
the Americans, they were ever much happier.
They had no ambition beyond enough for the
passing hour: with that they were perfectly contented.
They were very patient of the deprivation,
when they had it not; and seasons of
scarcity saw no cessation of music and dancing,
no abridgment of the jest and song. If the
earth yielded enough in one year to sustain them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
till the next, the amount of labor expended for
that object was never increased&mdash;superfluity
they cared nothing for: and commerce, save
such limited trade as was necessary to provide
their few luxuries, was beyond both their capacity
and desires. The prolific soil was suffered
to retain its juices; it was reserved for another
people to discover and improve its infinite productiveness.</p>

<p>They were indolent, careless, and improvident.
Great enterprises were above or below them.
Political interests, and the questions concerning
national dominion, were too exciting to charm
their gentle natures. Their intelligence was, of
course, not of the highest order: but they had
no use for learning&mdash;literature was out of place
in the wilderness&mdash;the pursuit of letters could
have found no sympathy, and for solitary enjoyment,
the Frenchman cultivates nothing. Life
was almost altogether sensuous: and, though
their morals were in keeping with their simplicity,
existence to them was chiefly a physical
matter. The fertility of the soil, producing all
the necessaries of life with a small amount of
labor, and the amenity of the climate, rendering
defences against winter but too easy, encouraged
their indolence, and soothed their scanty energy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They made no attempt,&rdquo; said one<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> who
knew them well, &ldquo;to acquire land from the
Indians, to organize a social system, to introduce
municipal regulations, or to establish military
defences; but cheerfully obeyed the priests
and the king's officers, and enjoyed the present
without troubling their heads about the future.
They seem to have been even careless as to the
acquisition of property, and its transmission to
their heirs. Finding themselves in a fruitful
country, abounding in game&mdash;where the necessaries
of life could be procured with little labor&mdash;where
no restraints were imposed by government,
and neither tribute nor personal service
was exacted, they were content to live in unambitious
peace and comfortable poverty. They
took possession of so much of the vacant land
around them, as they were disposed to till, and
no more. Their agriculture was rude: and even
to this day, some of the implements of husbandry
and modes of cultivation, brought from
France a century ago, remain unchanged by the
march of mind or the hand of innovation.
Their houses were comfortable, and they reared
fruits and flowers, evincing, in this respect, an
attention to comfort and luxury, which has not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
been practised by the English and American
first settlers. But in the accumulation of property,
and in all the essentials of industry, they
were indolent and improvident, rearing only the
bare necessaries of life, and living from generation
to generation without change or improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They reared fruits and flowers,&rdquo; he says;
and this simple fact denotes a marked distinction
between them and the Americans, not only in
regard to the things themselves, as would seem
to be the view of the author quoted, but in
mental constitution, modes of thought, and
motives to action. Their tastes were elegant,
ornate, and refined. They found pleasure in
pursuits which the American deems trivial,
frivolous, and unworthy of exertion.</p>

<p>If any trees sheltered the house of the American,
they were those planted by the winds; if
there were any flowers at his door, they were
only those with which prodigal nature has carpeted
the prairies; and you may see now in the
west, many a cabin which has stood for thirty
years, with not a tree, of shade or fruit, within
a mile of its door! Everything is as bare and
as cheerless about the door-yard, as it was the
first winter of its enclosure. But, stretching
away from it, in every direction, sometimes for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
miles, you will see extensive and productive
fields of grain, in the highest state of cultivation.
It is not personal comfort, or an elegant residence,
for which the American cares, but the
enduring and solid results of unwearied labor.</p>

<p>A Frenchman's residence is surrounded by
flower-beds and orchards; his windows are
covered by creeping-vines and trellis-work;
flower-pots and bird-cages occupy the sills and
surround the corridors; everything presents the
aspect of elegant taste, comfort, and indolence.
The extent of his fields, the amount of his produce,
the intelligence and industry of his cultivation,
bear an immense disproportion to those
of his less ornamental, though more energetic,
neighbor.</p>

<br />
<p>The distinction between the two races is as
clear in their personal appearance and bearing,
as in the aspect of their plantations. The
Frenchman is generally a spruce, dapper little
gentleman, brisk, obsequious, and insinuating
in manner, and usually betraying minute attention
to externals. The American is always plain
in dress&mdash;evincing no more taste in costume
than in horticulture&mdash;steady, calm, and never
lively in manner: blunt, straightforward, and
independent in discourse. The one is amiable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and submissive, the other choleric and rebellious.
The Frenchman always recognises and
bows before superior rank: the American acknowledges
no superior, and bows to no man
save in courtesy. The former is docile and
easily governed: the latter is intractable, beyond
control. The Frenchman accommodates
himself to circumstances: the American forces
circumstances to yield to him.</p>

<p>The consequence has been, that while the
American has stamped his character upon the
whole country, there are not ten places in the
valley of the Mississippi, where you would infer,
from anything you see, that a Frenchman
had ever placed his foot upon the soil. The few
localities in which the French character yet
lingers, are fast losing the distinction; and a
score or two of years will witness a total disappearance
of the gentle people and their primitive
abodes. Even now&mdash;excepting in a few
parishes in Louisiana&mdash;the relics of the race
bear a faded, antiquated look: as if they belonged
to a past century, as, indeed, they do,
and only lingered now, to witness, for a brief
space, the glaring innovations of the nineteenth,
and then, lamenting the follies of modern civilization,
to take their departure for ever!</p>

<p>Let them depart in peace! For they were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
gentle and pacific race, and in their day did
many kindly things!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The goodness of the heart is shown in deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of peacefulness and kindness.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Their best monument is an affectionate recollection

<span class="caption">THE RANGER.</span>
</div>

<p>In elaborating the character of the pioneer,
we have unavoidably anticipated, in some measure,
that of the Ranger&mdash;for the latter was, in
fact, only one of the capacities in which the
former sometimes acted. But&mdash;since, in the
preceding article, we have endeavored to
confine the inquiry, so as to use the term <i>Pioneer</i>
as almost synonymous with <i>Immigrant</i>&mdash;we
have, of course, ignored, to some extent,
the subordinate characters, in which he frequently
figured. We therefore propose, now,
briefly to review one or two of them in their
natural succession.</p>

<p>The progress of our country may be traced
and measured, by the representative characters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
which marked each period. The missionary-priest
came first, when the land was an unbroken
wilderness. The military adventurer,
seeking to establish new empires, and acquire
great fortunes, entered by the path thus opened.
Next came the hunter, roaming the woods in
search of wild beasts upon which he preyed.
Making himself familiar with the pathless forest
and the rolling prairie, he qualified himself
to guide, even while he fled from, the stream
of immigration. At last came the pioneer, to
drive away the savage, to clear out the forests,
and reclaim the land.</p>

<p>At first, he was <i>only</i> a pioneer. He had few
neighbors, he belonged to no community&mdash;his
household was his country, his family were his
only associates or companions. In the course
of time others followed him&mdash;he could occasionally
meet a white man on the prairies; if he
wandered a few miles from home, he could see
the smoke of another chimney in the distance.
If he did not at once abandon his &ldquo;clearing&rdquo;
and go further west, he became, in some sort, a
member of society&mdash;was the fellow-citizen of
his neighbors. The Indians became alarmed
for their hunting grounds, or the nations went
to war and drew them into the contest: the
frontier became unsafe: the presence of danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
drew the pioneers together: they adopted a system
of defence, and the ranger was the offspring
and representative of a new order of things.</p>

<p>Rough and almost savage as he sometimes
was, he was still the index to a great improvement.
Rude as the system was, it gave shape
and order to what had before been mere chaos.</p>

<br />
<p>The ranger marks a new era, then; his existence
is another chapter in the history of the
west. Previous to his time, each pioneer depended
only on himself for defence&mdash;his sole
protection, against the wild beast and the savage,
was his rifle&mdash;self-dependence was his peculiar
characteristic. The idea of a fighting establishment&mdash;the
germ of standing armies&mdash;had never
occurred to him: even the rudest form of civil
government was strange to him&mdash;taxes, salaries,
assessments, were all &ldquo;unknown quantities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, gradually, all this changed; and with
his circumstances, his character was also modified.
He lost a little of his sturdy independence,
his jealousy of neighborhood was softened&mdash;his
solitary habits became more social&mdash;he
acknowledged the necessity for concert of action&mdash;he
merged a part of his individuality
into the community, and&mdash;became a ranger.</p>

<p>In this capacity, his character was but little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
different to what it had been before the change;
and, though that change was a great improvement,
considered with reference to society, it
may safely be doubted whether it made the individual
more respectable. He was a better
<i>citizen</i>, because he now contributed to the common
defence: but he was not a better <i>man</i>,
because new associations brought novel temptations,
and mingling with other men wore
away the simplicity, which was the foundation
of his manliness. Before assuming his new
character, moreover, he never wielded a weapon
except in his own defence&mdash;or, at most, in
avenging his own wrongs. The idea of justice&mdash;claiming
reparation for an injury, which he
alone could estimate, because by him alone it
was sustained&mdash;protected his moral sense. But,
when he assumed the vindication of his neighbor's
rights, and the reparation of his wrongs&mdash;however
kind it may have been to do so&mdash;he
was sustained only by the spirit of hatred to
the savage, could feel no such justification as
the consciousness of injury.</p>

<p>Here was the first introduction of the mercenary
character, which actuates the hireling
soldier; and, though civilization was not then
far enough advanced, to make it very conspicuous,
there were other elements mingled, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
could not but depreciate the simple nobility of
the pioneer's nature. Many of the qualities
which, in him, had been merely passive, in the
ranger became fierce and active. We have alluded,
for example, to his hatred of the Indian;
and this, habit soon strengthened and exaggerated.
Nothing marks that change so plainly as
his adoption of the barbarous practice of scalping
enemies.</p>

<p>For this there might be some little palliation
in the fact, that the savage never considered a
warrior overcome, though he were killed, unless
he lost his scalp; and so long as he could
bring off the dead bodies of his comrades, not
mutilated by the process, he was but partially
intimidated. Defeat was, in that case, converted
to a sort of triumph; and having gone within
one step of victory&mdash;for so this half-success
was estimated&mdash;was the strongest incentive to
a renewal of the effort. It might be, therefore,
that the ranger's adoption of the custom was a
measure of self-defence. But it is to be feared
that this consideration&mdash;weak as it is, when
stated as an excuse for cruelty so barbarous&mdash;had
but little influence in determining the ranger.
Adopting the code of the savage, the practice
soon became a part of his warfare; and
the taking of the scalp was a ceremony neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>sary
to the completion of his victory. It was a
bloody and inhuman triumph&mdash;a custom, which
tended, more forcibly than any other, to degrade
true courage to mere cruelty; and which,
while it only mortified the savage, at the same
time, by rendering his hatred of the white men
more implacable, aggravated the horrors of Indian
warfare. But the only measure of justice
in those days, was the <i>lex talionis</i>&mdash;&ldquo;An eye
for an eye,&rdquo; a scalp for a scalp; and, even
now, you may hear frontiermen justify, though
they do not practise it, by quoting the venerable
maxim, &ldquo;Fight the devil with fire.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>But, though the warfare of the ranger was
sometimes distinguished by cruelty, it was also
ennobled by features upon which it is far more
pleasant to dwell.</p>

<p>No paladin, or knight, of the olden times,
ever exhibited more wild, romantic daring,
than that which formed a part of the ranger's
daily action. Danger, in a thousand forms,
beset him at every step&mdash;he defied mutilation,
death by fire and lingering torture. The number
of his enemies, he never counted, until after
he had conquered them&mdash;the power of the
tribe, or the prowess of the warrior, was no element
in his calculations. Where he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
strike first and most effectually, was his only
inquiry. Securing an avenue for retreat was
no part of his strategy&mdash;for he had never an
intention or thought of returning, except as a
victor. &ldquo;Keeping open his communications,&rdquo;
either with the rear or the flanks, had no place
in his system; &ldquo;combined movements&rdquo; he seldom
attempted, for he depended for victory,
upon the force he chanced to have directly at
hand. The distance from his &ldquo;base of operations&rdquo;
he never measured; for he carried all
his supplies about his person, and he never
looked for reinforcements. Bridges and wagon-roads
he did not require, for he could swim all
the rivers, and he never lost his way in the forest.
He carried his artillery upon his shoulder,
his tactics were the maxims of Indian warfare,
and his only drill was the &ldquo;ball-practice&rdquo; of
the woods. He was his own commissary, for
he carried his &ldquo;rations&rdquo; on his back, and replenished
his havresack with his rifle. He
needed no quartermaster; for he furnished his
own &ldquo;transportation,&rdquo; and selected his own
encampment&mdash;his bed was the bosom of mother-earth,
and his tent was the foliage of an oak
or the canopy of heaven. In most cases&mdash;especially
in battle&mdash;he was his own commander,
too; for he was impatient of restraint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and in savage warfare knew his duty as well as
any man could instruct him. Obedience was
no part of his nature&mdash;subordination was irksome
and oppressive. In a word, he was an
excellent soldier, without drill, discipline or
organization.</p>

<p>He was as active as he was brave&mdash;as untiring
as he was fearless.</p>

<p>A corps of rangers moved so rapidly, as apparently
to double its numbers&mdash;dispersing on
the Illinois or Missouri, and reassembling on
the Mississippi, on the following day&mdash;traversing
the Okan timber to-day, and fording the
Ohio to-morrow. One of them, noted among
the Indians for desperate fighting, and personally
known for many a bloody meeting, would
appear so nearly simultaneously in different
places, as to acquire the title of a &ldquo;Great Medicine;&rdquo;
and instances have been known, where
as many as three distinct war-parties have told
of obstinate encounters with the same men in
one day! Their apparent ubiquity awed the
Indians more than their prowess.</p>

<br />
<p>General Benjamin Howard, who, in eighteen
hundred and thirteen resigned the office of governor
of Missouri, and accepted the appointment
of brigadier-general, in command of the militia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and rangers of Missouri and Illinois, at no time,
except for a few weeks in eighteen hundred and
fourteen, had more than one thousand men under
his orders: And yet, with this inconsiderable
force, he protected a frontier extending
from the waters of the Wabash, westward to the
advanced settlements of Missouri&mdash;driving the
savages northward beyond Peoria, and intimidating
them by the promptitude and rapidity
of his movements.</p>

<br />
<p>Our government contributed nothing to the
defence of its frontiers, except an act of Congress,
which authorized them to defend themselves!
The Indians, amounting to at least
twenty tribes, had been stirred up to hostility
by the British, and, before the establishment
of rangers, were murdering and plundering almost
with impunity. But soon after the organization
of these companies, the tide began to
turn. The ranger was at least a match for the
savage in his own mode of warfare; and he had,
moreover, the advantages of civilized weapons,
and a steadiness and constancy, unknown to
the disorderly war-parties of the red men.</p>

<p>He was persevering beyond all example, and
exhibited endurance which astonished even the
stoical savage. Three or four hours' rest, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
weeks of hardship and exposure, prepared him
for another expedition. If the severity of his
vengeance, or the success of a daring enterprise,
intimidated the Indian for a time, and
gave him a few days' leisure, he grew impatient
of inactivity, and was straightway planning
some new exploit. The moment one suggested
itself, he set about accomplishing it&mdash;and
its hardihood and peril caused no hesitation.
He would march, on foot, hundreds of
miles, through an unbroken wilderness, until
he reached the point where the blow was to be
struck; and then, awaiting the darkness, in the
middle of the night, he would fall upon his unsuspecting
enemies and carry all before him.</p>

<br />
<p>During the war of independence, the rangers
had not yet assumed that name, nor were
they as thoroughly organized, as they became
in the subsequent contest of eighteen hundred
and twelve. But the same material was there&mdash;the
same elements of character, actuated by
the same spirit. Let the following instance
show what that spirit was.</p>

<p>In the year seventeen hundred and seventy-seven,
there lived at Cahokia&mdash;on the east
side of the Mississippi below Saint Louis&mdash;a
Pennsylvanian by the name of Brady&mdash;a rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>less,
daring man, just made for a leader of rangers.
In an interval of inactivity, he conceived
the idea of capturing one of the British posts in
Michigan, the nearest point of which was at
least three hundred miles distant! He forthwith
set about raising a company&mdash;and, at the
end of three days, found himself invested with
the command of <i>sixteen men</i>! With these, on
the first of October, he started on a journey of
more than one hundred leagues, through the
vast solitudes of the prairies and the thousand
perils of the forest, to take a military station,
occupied by a detachment of British soldiers!
After a long and toilsome march, they reached
the banks of the St. Joseph's river, on which
the object of their expedition stood. Awaiting
the security of midnight, they suddenly broke
from their cover in the neighborhood, and by a
<i>coup de main</i>, captured the fort without the loss
of a man! Thus far all went well&mdash;for besides
the success and safety of the party, they found
a large amount of stores, belonging to traders,
in the station, and were richly paid for their enterprise&mdash;but
having been detained by the footsore,
on their homeward march, and probably
delayed by their plunder, they had only reached
the Calumet, on the borders of Indiana, when
they were overtaken by three hundred British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and Indians! They were forced to surrender,
though not without a fight, for men of that
stamp were not to be intimidated by numbers.
They lost in the skirmish one fourth of their
number: the survivors were carried away to
Canada, whence Brady, the leader, escaped, and
returned to Cahokia the same winter. The
twelve remained prisoners until seventeen hundred
and seventy-nine.</p>

<br />
<p>Against most men this reverse would have
given the little fort security&mdash;at least, until the
memory of the disaster had been obscured by
time. But the pioneers of that period were not
to be judged by ordinary rules. The very next
spring (1778), another company was raised for
the same object, and to wipe out what they considered
the stain of a failure. It was led by a
man named Maize, over the same ground, to the
same place, and was completely successful.
The fort was retaken, the trading-station plundered,
the wounded men of Brady's party released,
and, loaded with spoil, the little party
marched back in triumph!</p>

<br />
<p>There is an episode in the history of their
homeward march, which illustrates another
characteristic of the ranger&mdash;his ruthlessness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
The same spirit which led him to disregard
physical obstacles, prevented his shrinking from
even direful necessities. One of the prisoners
whom they had liberated, became exhausted
and unable to proceed. They could not carry
him, and would not have him to die of starvation
in the wilderness. They could not halt
with him, lest the same fate should overtake
them, which had defeated the enterprise of
Brady. But one alternative remained, and
though, to us, it appears cruel and inhuman, it
was self-preservation to them, and mercy, in a
strange guise, to the unhappy victim&mdash;<i>he was
despatched by the hand of the leader</i>, and
buried upon the prairie! His grave is somewhere
near the head-waters of the Wabash, and
has probably been visited by no man from that
day to this!</p>

<p>Mournful reflections cluster round such a
narrative as this, and we are impelled to use
the word &ldquo;atrocious&rdquo; when we speak of it. It
was certainly a bloody deed, but the men of
those days were not nurtured in drawing-rooms,
and never slept upon down-beds. A state of
war, moreover, begets many evils, and none
of them are more to be deplored than the occasional
occurrence of such terrible necessities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The ranger-character, like the pioneer-nature
of which it was a phase, was compounded of
various and widely-differing elements. No one
of his evil qualities was more prominent than
several of the good; and, I am sorry to say,
none of the good was more prominent than
several of the bad. No class of men did more
efficient service in defending the western settlements
from the inroads of the Indians; and
though it seems hard that the war should sometimes
have been carried into the country of the
untutored savage by civilized men, with a
severity exceeding his own, we should remember
that we can not justly estimate the motives
and feelings of the ranger, without first having
been exasperated by his sufferings and tried by
his temptations.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of peace between England
and America, in eighteen hundred and fifteen,
the Indians, who had been instigated and supported
in their hostility by the British, suddenly
found themselves deprived of their allies. If
they now made war upon the Americans, they
must do so upon their own responsibility, and,
excepting the encouragement of a few traders
and commanders of outposts, whose enmity
survived the general pacification, without assistance
from abroad. They, however, refused to
lay down their arms, and hostilities were continued,
though languidly, for some years longer.
But the rangers, now disciplined by the experience
of protracted warfare, and vastly increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in numbers, had grown to be more than a match
for them, so that not many years elapsed before
the conclusion of a peace, which has lasted,
with but occasional interruptions, to the present
day.</p>

<p>When danger no longer threatened the settlements,
there was no further call for these irregular
troops. The companies were disbanded,
and those who had families, as a large proportion
of them had, returned to their plantations,
and resumed the pursuits of industry and peace.
Those who had neither farms nor families, and
were unfitted by their stirring life for regular
effort, emigrated further west. Peace settled
upon our borders, never, we hope, to be seriously
broken.</p>

<br />
<p>But as soon as the pressure of outward danger
was withdrawn, and our communities began to
expand, the seeds of new evils were developed&mdash;seeds
which had germinated unobserved,
while all eyes were averted, and which now
began to shoot up into a stately growth of vices
and crimes. The pioneers soon learned that
there was among them a class of unprincipled
and abandoned men, whose only motive in
emigrating was to avoid the restraints, or escape
the penalties, of law, and to whom the freedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of the wilderness was a license to commit every
sort of depredation. The arm of the law was
not yet strong enough to punish them.</p>

<p>The territorial governments were too busy in
completing their own organization, to give
much attention to details: where states had
been formed, the statute-book was yet a blank:
few officers had been appointed, and even these
were strangers to their duties and charge of responsibility.
Between the military rule of the
rangers&mdash;for they were for internal police as
well as external defence&mdash;and the establishment
of regular civil government, there was a sort
of interregnum, during which there was neither
law nor power to enforce it. The bands of
villains who infested the country were the only
organizations known; and, in not a few instances,
these bands included the very magistrates
whose duty it was to see that the laws
were faithfully executed. Even when this was
not the case, it was a fruitless effort to arrest a
malefactor; indeed, it was very often worse than
fruitless, for his confederates were always ready
to testify in his favor: and the usual consequence
of an attempt to punish, was the drawing
down upon the head of the complainant or
prosecutor, the enmity of a whole confederacy.
Legal proceedings, had provision been made for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
such, were worse than useless, for conviction
was impossible: and the effort exasperated,
while the failure encouraged, the outlaw spirit.</p>

<p>An <i>alibi</i> was the usual defence, and to those
times may be referred the general prejudice entertained
among our people, even at the present
day, against that species of testimony. A jury
of western men will hardly credit an <i>alibi</i>,
though established by unexceptionable witnesses;
and the announcement that the accused
depends upon that for his defence, will create
a strong prejudice against him in advance. Injustice
may sometimes be done in this way, but
it is a feeling of which our people came honestly
in possession. They established a habit, in early
days, of never believing an <i>alibi</i>, because, at
that time, nine <i>alibis</i> in ten were false, and
habits of thought, like legal customs, cling to
men long after their reason has ceased. It is
right, too, that it should be so, on the principle
that we should not suspend the use of the
remedy until the disease be thoroughly conquered.</p>

<br />
<p>In a state of things, such as we have described,
but one of two things could be done:
the citizens must either abandon all effort to
assert the supremacy of order, and give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
country over to thieves and robbers, or they
must invent some new and irregular way of
forcing men to live honestly. They wisely
chose the latter alternative. They consulted
together, and the institution of <i>Regulators</i> was
the result of their deliberations.</p>

<p>These were small bodies of men, chosen by
the people, or voluntarily assuming the duty&mdash;men
upon whom the citizens could depend for
both discretion and resolution. Their duties
may be explained in a few words: to ferret out
and punish criminals, to drive out &ldquo;suspicious
characters,&rdquo; and exercise a general supervision
over the interests and police of the settlements,
from which they were chosen. Their statute-book
was the &ldquo;code of Judge Lynch&rdquo;&mdash;their
order of trial was similar to that of a &ldquo;drum-head
court-martial&rdquo;&mdash;the principles of their
punishment was certainty, rapidity, and severity.
They were judges, juries, witnesses, and
executioners.</p>

<br />
<p>They bound themselves by a regular compact
(usually verbal, but sometimes in writing<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>), to
the people and to each other, to rid the community
of all thieves, robbers, plunderers, and
villains of every description. They scoured the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
country in all directions and in all seasons, and
by the swiftness of their movements, and the
certainty of their vengeance, rivalled their predecessors,
the rangers. When a depredation
had been committed, it was marvellous with
what rapidity every regulator knew it; even
the telegraph of modern days performs no
greater wonders: and it frequently happened,
that the first the quiet citizens heard of a theft,
or a robbery, was the news of its punishment!
Their acts may sometimes have been high-handed
and unjustifiable, but on the whole&mdash;and
it is only in such a view that social institutions
are to be estimated&mdash;they were the preservers
of the communities for whom they acted.
In time, it is true, they degenerated, and sometimes
the corps fell into the hands of the very
men they were organized to punish.</p>

<br />
<p>Every social organization is liable to misdirection,
and this, among others, has been perverted
to the furtherance of selfish and unprincipled
purposes; for, like prejudices and habits
of thought, organized institutions frequently
survive the necessities which call them into
existence. Abuses grow up under all systems;
and, perhaps, the worst abuse of all, is a measure
or expedient, good though temporary, re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>tained
after the passing away of the time for
which it was adopted.</p>

<br />
<p>But having, in the article &ldquo;Pioneer,&rdquo; sufficiently
elaborated the <i>character</i>&mdash;for the regulator
was of course a pioneer also&mdash;we can best
illustrate the mode of his action by a narrative
of facts. From the hundreds of well-authenticated
stories which might be collected, I have
chosen the two following, because they distinguish
the successive stages or periods of the
system. The first relates to the time when a
band of regulators was the only reliable legal
power, and when, consequently, the vigilance
of the citizens kept it comparatively pure. The
second indicates a later period, when the people
no longer felt insecure, and there was in fact no
necessity for the system; and when, not having
been disused, it could not but be abused. We
derive both from an old citizen of the country,
who was an actor in each. One of them, the
first, has already been in print, but owing to
circumstances to which it is needless to advert,
it was thought better to confine the narrative to
facts already generally known. These circumstances
are no longer operative, and I am now
at liberty to publish entire the story of &ldquo;The
First Grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>THE FIRST GRAVE.</h4>

<p>At the commencement of the war of eighteen
hundred and twelve, between Great Britain and
the United States, there lived, in the western
part of Virginia, three families, named, respectively,
Stone, Cutler, and Roberts. They were
all respectable people, of more than ordinary
wealth; having succeeded, by an early emigration
and judicious selection of lands, in rebuilding
fortunes which had been somewhat impaired
east of the Blue Ridge. Between the first and
second there was a relationship, cemented by
several matrimonial alliances, and the standing
of both had been elevated by this union of fortunes.
In each of these two, there were six or
seven children&mdash;the most of them boys&mdash;but
Captain Roberts, the head of the third, had but
one child, a daughter, who, in the year named,
was approaching womanhood.</p>

<p>She is said to have been beautiful: and, from
the extravagant admiration of those who saw
her only when time and suffering must have
obscured her attractions, there can be little
doubt that she was so. What her character
was, we can only conjecture from the tenor of
our story: though we have reason to suspect that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
she was passionate, impulsive, and somewhat
vain of her personal appearance.</p>

<p>At the opening of hostilities between the two
countries, she was wooed by two suitors, young
Stone, the eldest of the sons of that family, and
Abram Cutler, who was two or three years his
senior. Both had recently returned home, after
a protracted absence of several years, beyond
the mountains, whither they had been sent by
their ambitious parents, &ldquo;to attend college and
see the world.&rdquo; Stone was a quiet, modest, unassuming
young man, rather handsome, but too
pale and thin to be decidedly so. Having made
the most of his opportunities at &ldquo;William and
Mary,&rdquo; he had come home well-educated (for
that day and country) and polished by intercourse
with good society.</p>

<p>His cousin, Abram Cutler, was his opposite
in almost everything. He had been wild, reckless,
and violent, at college, almost entirely
giving up his studies, after the first term, and
always found in evil company. His manners
were as much vitiated as his morals, for he was
exceedingly rough, boisterous, and unpolished:
so much so, indeed, as to approach that limit
beyond which wealth will not make society
tolerant. But his freedom of manner bore, to
most observers, the appearance of generous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
heartiness, and he soon gained the good will of
the neighborhood by the careless prodigality
of his life. He was tall, elegantly formed, and
quite well-looking; and though he is said to
have borne, a few years later, a sinister and dishonest
look, it is probable that most of this was
attributable to the preconceived notions of those
who thus judged him.</p>

<br />
<p>Both these young men were, as we have said,
suitors for the hand of Margaret Roberts, and
it is possible that the vain satisfaction of having
at her feet the two most attractive young men
in the country, led her to coquet with them both,
but decidedly to prefer neither. It is almost
certain, that at the period indicated, she was
sufficiently well-pleased with either to have become
his wife, had the other been away. If
she <i>loved</i> either, however, it was Stone, for she
was a little timid, and Cutler sometimes frightened
her with his violence: but the preference,
if it existed at all, was not sufficiently strong to
induce a choice.</p>

<p>About this time, the elder Cutler died, and it
became necessary for Abram, as executor of a
large estate, to cross the mountains into the Old
Dominion, and arrange its complicated affairs.
It was not without misgiving that he went away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
but his duties were imperative, and his necessities,
produced by his spendthrift habits, were
pressing. He trusted to a more than usually
favorable interview with Margaret, and full of
sanguine hopes, departed on his journey.</p>

<p>Whether Stone entertained the idea of taking
an unfair advantage of his rival's absence, we
can not say, but he straightway became more
assiduous in his attentions to Margaret. He
was also decidedly favored by Captain Roberts
and his wife, both of whom had been alarmed
by the violent character of Cutler. Time soon
began to obscure the recollection of the absent
suitor, and Stone's delicate and considerate
gallantry rapidly gained ground in Margaret's
affections. It was just one month after Cutler's
departure that his triumph was complete; she
consented to be his wife so soon as the minister
who travelled on that circuit should enter the
neighborhood. But the good man had set out
on his circuit only the day before the consent
was given, and it would probably be at least a
month before his return. In the meantime,
Cutler might recross the mountains, and Stone
had seen quite enough of Margaret's capriciousness
to tremble for the safety of his conquest,
should that event occur before it was thoroughly
secured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>This was embarrassing: but when a man is
in earnest, expedients are never wanting.</p>

<br />
<p>There was an old gentleman living a few
miles from the valley, who had once held the
commission of a justice of the peace, and
though he had not exercised his functions, or
even claimed his dignity, for several years, Stone
was advised that he retained his official power
&ldquo;until his successor was appointed and qualified,&rdquo;
and that, consequently, any official act of
his would be legal and valid. He was advised,
moreover, and truly, that even if the person performing
the ceremony were not a magistrate, a
marriage would be lawful and binding upon the
simple &ldquo;consent&rdquo; of the parties, properly published
and declared.</p>

<p>Full-freighted with the happy news, he posted
away to Captain Roberts, and without difficulty
obtained his sanction. He then went to Margaret,
and, with the assistance of her mother,
who stood in much dread of Cutler's violence,
succeeded in persuading her to consent. Without
delay, the <i>cidevant</i> magistrate was called in,
the ceremony was performed, and Margaret was
Stone's wife!</p>

<p>The very day after this event, Cutler returned!
What were his thoughts no one knew, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
he spoke to none upon the subject. He went,
however, to see &ldquo;the bride,&rdquo; and, in the presence
of others, bantered her pleasantly upon her new
estate, upon his own pretensions, and upon the
haste with which the ceremony had been performed.
He started away with the rest of the
company present; but, on reaching the door&mdash;it
was afterward remembered&mdash;pretended to
have forgotten something, and ran back into the
room where they had left Margaret alone. Here
he remained full ten minutes, and when he came
out walked thoughtfully apart and disappeared.
What he said to Margaret no one knew; but,
that evening, when they were alone, she asked
anxiously of her husband, &ldquo;whether he was
quite sure that their marriage had been legal?&rdquo;
Stone reassured her, and nothing more was said
upon the subject.</p>

<br />
<p>Cutler had brought with him, over the mountains,
the proclamation of the governor of Virginia,
announcing the declaration of war, and
calling upon the state for its quota of troops to
repel invasion. He manifested a warm interest
in the enrolling and equipment of volunteers,
and, in order to attest his sincerity, placed his
own name first upon the roll. A day or two
afterward, on meeting Stone, in the presence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
several others who had enrolled themselves, he
laughingly observed, that the new bridegroom
&ldquo;was probably too comfortable at home, to desire
any experience in campaigning:&rdquo; and, turning
away, he left the company laughing at
Stone's expense.</p>

<p>This touched the young man's pride&mdash;probably
the more closely, because he was conscious
that the insinuation was not wholly void of truth&mdash;and,
without a moment's hesitation, he called
Cutler back, took the paper, and enrolled his
name. Cutler laughed again, said <i>he</i> would
not have done so, had he been in Stone's circumstances,
and, after some further conversation,
walked away in the direction of Stone's
residence. Whether he actually entered the
house is not known; but when the young husband
returned home, a few hours afterward, his
wife's first words indicated that she knew of his
enrolment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said she, with some asperity,
&ldquo;that you already care so little for me as to enrol
yourself for an absence of six months?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stone would much have preferred to break
the news to her himself, for he had some foreboding
as to the view she might take of his
conduct. He had scarcely been married a week,
and he was conscious that a severe construction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of the act of enrolment, when there was notoriously
not the least necessity for it, might
lead to inferences, than which, nothing could
be more false. If he had said, at once, that he
had been taunted by his old rival, and written
his name under the influence of pride, all would
have been well, for his wife would then have
understood, though she might not have approved
his action. But this confession he was
ashamed to make, and, by withholding it, laid
the foundation for his own and his wife's destruction.
He at once acknowledged the fact,
disclaiming, however, the indifference to her,
which she inferred, and placing the act upon
higher ground:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger of the country,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
very imminent, and it became every good citizen
to do all he could for its defence. He had no
idea that the militia would be called far from
home, or detained for a very long time; but, in
any event, he felt that men were bound, in such
circumstances, to cast aside personal considerations,
and contribute, each his share, to the
common defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife gazed incredulously at him while he
talked this high patriotism: and well she might,
for he did not speak as one moved by such feelings.
The consciousness of deceit, of conceal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ment,
and of childish rashness, rendered his
manner hesitating and embarrassed. Margaret
observed all this, for her jealousy was aroused
and her suspicions sharpened; she made no
reply, however, but turned away, with a toss of
the head, and busied herself, quite fiercely, with
her household cares. From that moment, until
the day of his departure, she stubbornly avoided
the subject, listening, but refusing to reply,
when her husband attempted to introduce it.
When Cutler came&mdash;rather unnecessarily, as
Stone thought&mdash;to consult him about the organization
of a spy-company, to which both
were attached, she paid no attention to their
conversation, but walked away down a road
over which she knew Cutler must pass on his
return homeward. Whether this was by appointment
with him is not known: probably,
however, it was her own motion.</p>

<br />
<p>We need not stay to detail all that took place
between her and her former suitor, when, as she
had expected, they met in a wood some hundreds
of yards from her home; its result will
sufficiently appear in the sequel. One circumstance,
however, we must not omit. She recurred
to a conversation which had passed sometime
before, in relation to the legality of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
marriage; and though Cutler gave no positive
opinion, his parting advice was nearly in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think, from your three weeks' experience,
that Stone cares enough for you to make
it prudent, I would advise you to have the marriage
ceremony performed by Parson Bowen,
immediately upon his return; and if you care
enough for him to wish to retain him, you had
better have it performed <i>before he goes away</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words, and without awaiting an
answer, he passed on, leaving her alone in the
road. When she returned home, she did not
mention the subject; and though Parson Bowen
returned to the neighborhood quite a week
before Stone went away, she never suggested a
repetition of the ceremony. When Stone manifested
some anxiety on the subject, she turned
suddenly upon him and demanded&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not think our marriage legal, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He assured her that he only made the suggestion
for her satisfaction, entertaining no
doubt, himself, that they were regularly and
lawfully married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am content to remain as I am,&rdquo; she said,
curtly, and the parson was not summoned.</p>

<p>Five days afterward the troops took up the
line of march for the frontier. Hull had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
yet surrendered Michigan; but Proctor had so
stirred up the Indians (who, until then, had been
quiet since the battle of Tippecanoe), as to cut
off all communication with the advanced settlements,
and even to threaten the latter with fire
and slaughter. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, were
then overrun by British and Indians; for Hopkins
had not yet commenced his march from
Kentucky, and Congress was still debating measures
for protection. Hull's surrender took place
on the sixteenth of August, eighteen hundred
and twelve, and in the following month, General
Harrison, having been appointed to the chief
command in the northwest, proceeded to adopt
vigorous measures for the defence of the country.
It was to one of the regiments organized by
him, that our friends from Virginia found themselves
attached. They had raised a company
of spies, and in this both Stone and Cutler held
commissions.</p>

<br />
<p>They marched with the regiment, or rather in
advance of it, for several weeks. By that time,
they had penetrated many miles beyond the
settlements, and Harrison began to feel anxious
to ascertain the position of General Hopkins,
and open communications with him. For this
service Cutler volunteered, and was imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>diately
selected by the general. On the following
morning, he set out with five men to seek
the Kentuckians. He found them without difficulty
and delivered his despatches; but from
that day he was not seen, either in the camp of
Hopkins or in that of Harrison! It was supposed
that he had started on his return, and
been taken or killed by the Indians, parties of
whom were prowling about between the lines
of the two columns.</p>

<br />
<p>Stone remained with his company two or
three months longer, when, the enterprise of
Hopkins having failed, and operations being
suspended for the time, it was thought inexpedient
to retain them for the brief period
which remained of their term of enlistment,
and they were discharged. Stone returned
home, and, full of anticipations, the growth of a
long absence, hastened at once to his own house.
The door was closed, no smoke issued from the
chimney, there was no one there! After calling
in vain for a long time, he ran away to her
father's, endeavoring to feel certain that he would
find her there. But the old man received him
with a mournful shake of the head. Margaret
had been gone more than a month, no one knew
whither or with whom!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>A report had been in circulation that Cutler
was seen in the neighborhood, a few days before
her disappearance; but no news having been
received of his absence from the army, it had
not been generally credited. But now, it was
quite clear!</p>

<br />
<p>The old man invited Stone to enter, but he
declined. Sitting down on a log, he covered his
face with his hands, for a few moments, and
seemed buried in grief. It did not last long,
however: he rose almost immediately, and going
a little aside, calmly loaded his rifle. Without
noticing the old man, who stood gazing at him
in wonder, he turned away, and, with his eyes
fixed upon the ground, took the path toward his
own house. He was seen to break the door and
enter, but he remained within only a few
minutes. On coming out, he threw his rifle
over his shoulder, and walked away through the
forest. Half an hour afterward, smoke was
seen issuing from the roof of the house in several
places, and on repairing thither, the neighbors
found the whole place in a bright flame! It
was of no use to attempt to save it or any of its
contents. An hour afterward, it was a heap of
smouldering ruins, and its owner had disappeared
from the country!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Seven years passed away.</p>

<p>The war was over: the Indians had been
driven to the north and west, and the tide of
emigration had again set toward the Mississippi.
The northwestern territory&mdash;especially
that part of it which is now included within the
limits of Illinois and Indiana&mdash;was rapidly filling
up with people from the south and east. The
advanced settlements had reached the site of
Springfield, in the &ldquo;Sangamon country,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> now
the capital of Illinois, and a few farms were
opened in the north of Madison county&mdash;now
Morgan and Scott. The beautiful valley, most
inaptly called, of the <i>Mauvaisterre</i>, was then
an unbroken wilderness.</p>

<p>The grass was growing as high as the head
of a tall man, where now well-built streets and
public squares are traversed by hurrying crowds.
Groves which have since become classic were
then impenetrable thickets; and the only guides
the emigrant found, through forest and prairie,
were the points of the compass, and the courses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of streams. But in the years eighteen hundred
and seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, the western
slope of the Sangamon country began
rapidly to improve. Reports had gone abroad
of &ldquo;the fertility of its soil, the beauty of its
surface, its genial climate, and its many advantages
of position&rdquo;&mdash;and there is certainly
no country which more richly deserves these
praises.</p>

<br />
<p>But the first emigrant who made his appearance
here, in the autumn of eighteen hundred
and nineteen, was probably moved by other
considerations. It was none other than Abram
Cutler! And his family consisted of a wife and
three young children! That wife was Margaret
Roberts&mdash;or rather Margaret Stone; for, notwithstanding
the representations of Cutler, her
union with Stone had been perfectly legal. By
what arts he had succeeded in inducing her to
elope with him, we can only judge from his
previous proceedings; but this is certain, that
resentment toward Stone, who, she probably believed,
had unfairly trapped her, was as likely
to move her impulsive and unstable spirit, as
any other motive. Add to this, the wound
given to her vanity by the sudden departure of
her young husband upon a long campaign, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the acuteness given to this feeling by the arts
of Cutler, and we shall not be at a loss to explain
her action.</p>

<p>Whether she had not bitterly repented her
criminal haste, we know not; but that hardship
and suffering of some sort had preyed upon her
spirit, was evident in her appearance. Her
beauty was much faded; she had grown pale
and thin; and though she was scarcely yet in
the prime of womanhood, her step was heavy
and spiritless. She was not happy, of course,
but her misery was not only negative: the
gnawings of remorse were but too positive and
real!</p>

<p>Cutler was changed almost as much as his
victim. The lapse of seven years had added a
score to his apparent age; and, if we are to
credit the representations of persons who were
probably looking for signs of vice, the advance
of time had brought out, in well-marked lineaments,
upon his countenance, the evil traits of
his character. His cheeks were sunken, his
features attenuated, and his figure exceedingly
spare, but he still exhibited marks of great personal
strength and activity. His glance, always
of doubtful meaning, was now unsettled and
furtive; and I have heard one of the actors in
this history assert, that it had a scared, appre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>hensive
expression, as if he were in constant
expectation of meeting a dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>Nor is this at all improbable, for during the
seven years which had elapsed since the consummation
of his design upon Margaret, he had
emigrated no less than three times&mdash;frightened
away, at each removal, by some intimation, or
suspicion, that the avenger was on his track!
No wonder that his look was wary, and his face
pale and haggard!</p>

<br />
<p>On this, his fourth migration, he had crossed
the prairies from the waters of the Wabash;
and having placed the wide expanse of waving
plain between him and the settlements, he at
length considered himself safe from pursuit.
Passing by the little trading-station, where
Springfield now stands, he traversed the beautiful
country lying between that and the Mauvaisterre.
But the alternation of stately timber
and lovely prairie had no charms for him: he
sought not beauty or fertility, but seclusion;
for his pilgrimage had become wearisome, and
his step was growing heavy. Remorse was at
his heart, and fear&mdash;the appealing face of his
patient victim kept his crime in continual remembrance&mdash;and
he knew, that like a blood-hound,
his enemy was following behind. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
was a weary load! No wonder that his cheeks
were thin or his eyes wild!</p>

<br />
<p>He passed on till he came to a quiet, secluded
spot, where he thought himself not likely soon
to be disturbed by emigration. It was sixteen
miles west of the place where Jacksonville has
since been built, upon the banks of the lower
Mauvaisterre, seven miles from the Illinois river.
The place was long known as Cutler's grove,
but a town grew up around it, and has been
christened by the sounding name of Exeter.
Those who visit it now, and have heard the
story of Cutler, will commend his judgment in
selecting it for retirement; for, town as it is, a
more secluded, dreamy little place is nowhere
to be found. It would seem that the passage
of a carriage through its <i>street</i>&mdash;for it has but
one&mdash;would be an event in its history; and the
only things which redeem it, in the fancy, from
the category of visionary existences, are a blacksmith's
shop and a mill!</p>

<br />
<p>But Cutler's trail was seen upon the prairies,
and the course of many an emigrant was determined
by the direction taken by his predecessor.
It was not long before others came to
&ldquo;settle&rdquo; in the neighborhood. Emigration was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
gradually encroaching, also, from the south;
families began to take possession of the river
&ldquo;bottoms;&rdquo; the smoke from frontier cabins
ascended in almost every point of timber; and
by the summer of eighteen hundred and twenty,
Cutler found himself as far from the frontier as
ever! But he was resolved not to move again:
a dogged spirit&mdash;half weariness, half despair&mdash;had
taken possession of him. &ldquo;I have moved
often enough,&rdquo; he said to Margaret, &ldquo;and here
I am determined to remain, come what may!&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>Actuated by such feelings&mdash;goaded by a fear
which he could not conquer, and yet was resolute
not to indulge&mdash;the lurking devil in his
nature could not long remain dormant. Nothing
develops evil tendencies so rapidly as the consciousness
of wrong and the fear of punishment.
His life soon became reckless and abandoned,
and the first sign of his degradation was his
neglect of his household. For days together
Margaret saw nothing of him; his only companions
were the worthless and outlawed; and,
when intoxicating liquors could be procured,
which was, fortunately, not often, he indulged
in fearful excesses.</p>

<p>Of evil company, there was, unhappily, but
too much; for the settlement was cursed with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
band of desperadoes, exiles from organized society,
who had sought the frontier to obtain
impunity for their misdeeds. The leaders of
this band were three brothers, whom no law
could control, no obligation restrain; and with
these men Cutler soon formed a close and suspicious
intimacy. The eyes of the citizens had
been for some time directed toward the companions,
by circumstances attending various
depredations; and, though unknown to themselves,
they were constantly watched by many
of their neighbors. It is uncertain whether
Cutler was acquainted with the character of the
men when his association with them first commenced,
for in none of the places where he had
lived, had he hitherto been suspected of crime.
It is most probable that he sought their company
because they were &ldquo;dissipated&rdquo; like himself;
and that, in the inception of their acquaintance,
there was no other bond between them than the
habit of intoxication.</p>

<br />
<p>Had we time and space, we would fain pause
here to reflect upon the position and feelings
of the false wife&mdash;deserted, in her turn, by him
for whom she had given up truth and honor&mdash;alone
in the wilderness with her children, whose
birth she could not but regret, and harassed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
thoughts which could not but be painfully self-condemning.
But we must hasten on.</p>

<br />
<p>In the autumn of eighteen hundred and
twenty, information was brought to the settlement,
that a store at Springfield (as it is now
called), had been entered and robbed&mdash;that the
leaders of the desperadoes above alluded to,
were suspected&mdash;and that the goods stolen were
believed to be concealed in Cutler's grove,
where they lived. Warrants were issued, and
the three were arrested; but the magistrate
before whom they were taken for examination,
was a timid and ignorant man; and by the interference
of Cutler, who assumed to be a lawyer,
they were examined separately, and allowed to
testify, each for the other! An officer who
knew no more than to permit this, of course
could do no less than discharge them. The
arrest and examination, however, crude and informal
as they were, confirmed the suspicions
of the citizens, and directed them, more vehemently
than ever, against Cutler, as well as his
friends. It satisfied them, moreover, that they
would never be able to reach these men through
the ordinary forms of law, and strengthened the
counsels of those who had already suggested
the organization of a company of regulators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>While these things were fermenting in the
minds of the people, the desperadoes, encouraged
by their success, and rendered bold by impunity,
committed their depredations more
frequently and openly than ever. It was remarked,
too, that Cutler, having committed
himself at the examination of friends, was now
more constantly and avowedly their associate;
and, since he was not a man to play a second
part, that they deferred to him on all occasions,
never moving without him, and treating him at
all times as an acknowledged leader. The
people observed, moreover, that from being, like
his neighbors, a small farmer of limited possessions,
he rose rapidly to what, on the frontier,
was considered affluence. He soon ceased to
labor on his lands, and set up a very considerable
&ldquo;store,&rdquo; importing his goods from Saint
Louis, and, by means of the whiskey he sold,
collecting all the idle and vicious of the settlement
constantly about him. His &ldquo;store&rdquo; was
in exceedingly bad repute, and the scanty reputation
which he had retained after the public
part he had taken before the magistrate, was
speedily lost.</p>

<br />
<p>Things were in this state in the spring of
eighteen hundred and twenty-one, when an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
gentleman of respectable appearance, who had
emigrated to this country by water, having been
pleased with the land in the neighborhood of
the place where the town of Naples now stands,
landed his family and effects, and settled upon
the &ldquo;bottom.&rdquo; It was soon rumored in the
settlement, that he had brought with him a large
amount of money; and it was also remarked
that Cutler and his three companions were constantly
with him, either at the &ldquo;Grove&rdquo; or on
the &ldquo;bottom.&rdquo; Whether the rumor was the
cause of their attention, or their assiduity the
foundation of the report, the reader must determine
for himself.</p>

<br />
<p>One evening in May, after a visit to this man,
where Cutler had been alone, he came home in
great haste, and suddenly announced to Margaret
his intention to &ldquo;sell out,&rdquo; and move further
westward! His unhappy victim supposed
she knew but too well the meaning of this new
movement: she asked no questions, but, with
a sigh of weariness, assented. On the following
day, he commenced hastily disposing of
his &ldquo;store,&rdquo; his stock, his cabin&mdash;everything, in
fact, save a few farming utensils, his furniture,
and a pair of horses. It was observed&mdash;for
there were many eyes upon him&mdash;that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
never ventured out after twilight, and, even in
the broad sunshine, would not travel far, alone
or unarmed. In such haste did he seem, that
he sold many of his goods at, what his friends
considered, a ruinous sacrifice. The fame of
great bargains brought many people to his
counter, so that, within ten days, his arrangements
were complete; and, much to the satisfaction
of his neighbors, he set out toward the
river.</p>

<p>Two of his associates accompanied him on his
journey&mdash;a precaution for which he would give
no reason, except that he wished to converse
with them on the way. He crossed the Illinois
near the mouth of the Mauvaisterre, and, turning
northward, in the evening reached a cabin
on the banks of M'Kee's creek, not more than
ten miles from his late residence. This house
had been abandoned by its former occupant, on
account of the forays of the Indians; but was
now partially refitted, as for a temporary abode.
Here, the people about &ldquo;the grove&rdquo; were surprised
to learn, a few days after Cutler's departure,
that he had halted with the apparent
intention to remain, at least for some time.</p>

<br />
<p>Their surprise was dissipated, however, within
a very few weeks. The old gentleman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
spoken of above, had left home upon a visit to
Saint Louis; and during his absence, his house
had been entered, and robbed of a chest containing
a large amount of money&mdash;while the
family were intimidated by the threats of men
disguised as savages.</p>

<br />
<p>This was the culmination of villany. The
settlement was now thoroughly aroused; and,
when one of these little communities was once
in earnest, it might safely be predicted that
<i>something</i> would be <i>done!</i></p>

<p>The first step was to call &ldquo;a meeting of the
friends of law and order;&rdquo; but no proclamation
was issued, no handbills were circulated, no
notices posted: not the least noise was made
about the matter, lest those against whom it
was to act, might hear of and prepare for it.
They came together quietly but speedily&mdash;each
man, as he heard of the appointment,
going forthwith to his neighbor with the news.
They assembled at a central point, where none
need be late in coming, and immediately proceeded
to business. The meeting was not altogether
a formal one&mdash;for purposes prescribed
by law&mdash;but it was a characteristic of those
men, to do everything &ldquo;decently and in
order&rdquo;&mdash;to give all their proceedings the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
sanction and solemnity of mature deliberation.
They organized the assemblage regularly&mdash;calling
one of the oldest and most respectable
of their number &ldquo;to the chair&rdquo; (which, on this
occasion, happened to be the root of a large
oak), and appointing a younger man secretary
(though they gave him no desk on which to
write). There was no man there who did not
fully understand what had brought them together;
but one who lived in the &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo;
and had been the mover of the organization,
was still called upon to &ldquo;explain the object of
the meeting.&rdquo; This he did in a few pointed
sentences, concluding with these significant
words: &ldquo;My friends, it is time that these rascals
were punished, and it is our duty to punish
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down, and a silence of some moments
ensued, when another arose, and, without any
preliminary remarks, moved that &ldquo;a company
of regulators be now organized, and that they
be charged with the duty of <i>seeing the law administered</i>.&rdquo;
The motion was seconded by
half a dozen voices&mdash;the question was put in
due form by the chairman, and decided unanimously
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>A piece of paper was produced, and the presiding
officer called on the meeting for volun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>teers.
Ten young men stepped forward, and
gave their names as rapidly as the secretary
could enrol them. In less than five minutes,
the company was complete&mdash;the chairman and
four of the meeting, as a committee, were directed
to retire with the volunteers, and see
that they were fully organized&mdash;and the meeting
adjourned. All, except the volunteers and
the committee, went directly home&mdash;satisfied
that the matter needed no further attention.
Those who remained entered the house and
proceeded to organize in the usual manner.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;compact&rdquo; was drawn up, by the terms
of which the regulators bound themselves to
each other, and to their neighbors, to ferret out
and punish the perpetrators of the offences,
which had recently disturbed the peace of the
settlement, and to rid the country of such villains
as were obnoxious to the friends of law
and order. This was then signed by the volunteers
as principals, and by the committee,
as witnesses; and was placed in the hands of
the chairman of the meeting for safekeeping.
It is said to be still in existence, though I have
never seen it, and do not know where it is to be
found.</p>

<p>When this arrangement was completed, the
committee retired, and the company repaired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to the woods, to choose a leader. They were
not long in selecting a certain Major B&mdash;&mdash;,
who had, for some weeks, made himself conspicuous,
by his loud denunciations of Cutler
and his associates, and his zealous advocacy of
&ldquo;strong measures.&rdquo; They had&mdash;one or two
of them, at least&mdash;some misgivings about this
appointment; for the major was inclined to be
a blusterer, and the courage of these men was
eminently silent. But after a few minutes' discussion,
the matter was decided, and the leader
was chosen without opposition. They at once
dispersed, to make arrangements for the performance
of their duties&mdash;having first appointed
an hour and a place of meeting. They were
to assemble at sunset on the same day, at the
point where the state road now crosses the
&ldquo;bluff;&rdquo; and were to proceed thence, without
delay, to Cutler's house on M'Kee's creek, a
distance of little more than eight miles. There
they were to search for the stolen property, and
whether they found it or not, were resolved to
notify Cutler to leave the country. But under
no circumstances were they to take his life, unless
it became necessary in self-defence.</p>


<p>The hour came, and with it, to the bluff,
came all the regulators&mdash;<i>save one</i>. But that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
one was a very important personage&mdash;none
other, indeed, than the redoubtable major,
who was to head the party. The nine were
there a considerable time before sunset, and
waited patiently for their captain's arrival;
though, already, there were whisperings from
those who had been doubtful of him in the
outset, that he would not keep his appointment.
And these were right&mdash;for, though they waited
long beyond the time, the absentee did not
make his appearance. It was afterward ascertained
that he excused himself upon the plea
of sudden illness; but he was very well again
on the following day, and his excuse was not
received. The ridicule growing out of the
affair, and his reduction from the rank of major
to that of captain, in derision, finally drove him
in disgrace from the country.</p>

<p>His defection left the little company without
a leader; and though they were determined
not to give up the enterprise, an obstacle to its
prosecution arose, in the fact that no one was
willing to replace the absent captain. Each
was anxious to play the part of a private, and
all had come prepared to discharge the duties
of the expedition, to the utmost of their ability.
But they were all young men, and no one felt
competent to take the responsibility of command.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>They were standing in a group, consulting
eagerly about their course, and, as one of them
afterward said, &ldquo;nearly at their wits' end,&rdquo;
when the circle was suddenly entered by another.
He had come upon them so noiselessly,
and they had been so much absorbed in their
council, that no one saw him until he stood in
their midst. Several of them, however, at once
recognised him, as a hunter who had recently
appeared in the southern part of the county,
and had lived a singularly solitary life. No
one knew his name, but, from his mode of
life, he was already known among those who
had heard of him, as &ldquo;the wild hunter.&rdquo;
He was but little above the medium height,
and rather slender in figure; but he was well
and firmly built, and immediately impressed
them with the idea of great hardihood and
activity. His face, though bronzed by exposure,
was still handsome and expressive; but
there was a certain wildness in the eye, and a
compression about the mouth, which gave it
the expression of fierceness, as well as resolution.
He was dressed in a hunting-shirt and
&ldquo;leggings&rdquo; of deer-skin, fringed or &ldquo;fingered&rdquo;
on the edges; and his head and feet were covered,
the one by a cap of panther's hide, and
the others by moccasins of dressed buckskin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
At his belt hung a long knife, and in his hand
he carried a heavy &ldquo;Kentucky rifle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he entered the circle, he dropped the
breech of the latter to the ground, and, leaning
calmly upon the muzzle, quietly surveyed the
countenances of the group, in profound silence.
The regulators were too much surprised to
speak while this was going on; and the stranger
seemed to be in no haste to open the conversation.
When he had finished his scrutiny,
however, he stepped back a pace or two, and
resuming his easy attitude, addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must pardon me, my friends,&rdquo; he
commenced, &ldquo;when I tell you, that I have
overheard all you have said in the last half
hour. I did not remain in that thicket, however,
for the purpose of eaves-dropping; but
having accidentally heard one of you mention
a name, the sound of which touches a chord
whose vibrations you can not understand, I
remained, almost against my own will, to learn
more. I thus became acquainted with the
object of your meeting, and the dilemma in
which you find yourselves placed by the absence
of your leader. Now, I have but little
interest in this settlement, and none in the preservation
of peace, or the vindication of law,
anywhere: but I have been seeking this man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Cutler, of whom you spoke, nearly nine years.
I supposed, a few days ago, that I had at last
found him; but on going to his house, I learned
that he had once more emigrated toward the
west. You seem to know where he is to be
found, and are without a leader: I wish to find
him, and, if you will accept my services, will
fill the place of your absent captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned away as he finished, allowing
them an opportunity for consultation among
themselves. The question was soon decided:
they called him back&mdash;announced their willingness
to accept him as their leader&mdash;and
asked his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is <i>Stone</i>,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<br />
<p>It was after nightfall when the little party
set out from the bluff. They had, then, more
than eight miles to travel, over a country entirely
destitute of roads, and cut up by numberless
sloughs and ponds. They had, moreover,
a considerable river to cross, and, after
that, several miles of their way lay through a
dense and pathless forest. But they were not
the men to shrink from difficulties, at any time;
and now they were carried along even more
resolutely, by the stern, unwavering spirit of
their new leader. Having once learned the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
direction, Stone put himself at the head of the
party, and strode forward, almost &ldquo;as the bird
flies,&rdquo; directly toward the point indicated, regardless
of slough, and swamp, and thicket.
He moved rapidly, too&mdash;so rapidly, indeed,
as to tax the powers of some of his followers
almost too severely. Notwithstanding this
swiftness, however, they could not avoid a
long delay at the river; and it was consequently
near midnight, when, having at last
accomplished a crossing, they reached the
bank of M'Kee's creek, and turned up toward
Cutler's house.</p>

<p>This stood in the centre of a &ldquo;clearing,&rdquo;
some two or three acres in extent; and upon
reaching its eastern limit, the little company
halted to reconnoitre. Notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour, they discovered that the
people of the house were still awake; and by
a bright light, which streamed through the
open door, they could see several men, sitting
and standing about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall make a good haul,&rdquo; said one of
the regulators; &ldquo;the whole gang is there.&rdquo;
And immediately the party were for rushing
forward. But Stone restrained them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have taken me
for your leader, and must obey my directions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then announced his determination to go
forward alone; instructing his men, however,
to follow at a little distance, but in no case to
show themselves until he should give the signal.
They agreed, though reluctantly, to this
arrangement, and then&mdash;silently, slowly, but
surely&mdash;the advance commenced. The hour
had at last arrived!</p>

<br />
<p>In the meantime, Cutler and his three friends
were passing the time quite pleasantly over a
bottle of backwoods nectar&mdash;commonly called
whiskey. They seemed well pleased, too, with
some recent exploit of theirs, and were evidently
congratulating themselves upon their dexterity;
for, as the &ldquo;generous liquid&rdquo; reeked
warmly to their brains, they chuckled over it,
and hinted at it, and winked knowingly at each
other, as if they enjoyed both the recollection
and the whiskey&mdash;as they probably did, exceedingly.
There were four present, as we
said&mdash;Cutler and the three worthies so often
alluded to. These last sat not far from the
open door; and each in his hand held a kerchief,
or something of that description, of
which the contents were apparently very precious;
for, at intervals of a few moments, each
raised his bundle between him and the light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and then were visible many circular prints, as
if made by the coinage of the mint. This idea
was strengthened, too, by several piles of gold
and silver, which lay upon the table near the
bottle, to which Cutler directed no infrequent
glances.</p>

<p>They had all been indulging pretty freely in
their devotions to the mythological liquid&mdash;rewarding
themselves, like soldiers after storming
a hostile city, for their hardships and
daring. There were a few coals in the chimney,
although it was early in the autumn; and
on them were lying dark and crumpled cinders,
as of paper, over which little sparks were slowly
creeping, like fiery insects. Cutler turned them
over with his foot, and there arose a small blue,
flickering blaze, throwing a faint, uncertain light
beneath the table, and into the further corners
of the room, and casting shadows of the money-bundles
on the open door.</p>

<br />
<p>If the betrayer could have known what eyes
were strained upon him, as he thus carelessly
thrust his foot among the cinders, how changed
his bearing would have been. Stone had now
approached within fifty paces of the house, and
behind him, slowly creeping after, were the
regulators. A broad band of light streamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
out across the clearing from the door, while, on
each side of this, all lay in shadow deepened by
the contrast. Through the shadows, cautiously
and silently came the footsteps of the avenger!
There was no trepidation, no haste&mdash;the strange
leader rather lingered, with a deadly slowness,
as if the movement was a pleasant one, and he
disliked to end it. But he never halted&mdash;not
even for a moment&mdash;he came, like fate, slowly,
but surely!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; said Cutler, and his voice
penetrated the stillness quite across the clearing,
&ldquo;let us take another drink, and then lie
down; we shall have a long journey to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all advanced to the table and drained
the bottle. Cutler drank last, and then went
back to the fire. He again stirred the smouldering
cinders with his foot, and, turning
about, advanced to close the door. But&mdash;he
halted suddenly in the middle of the room&mdash;his
face grew ashy pale&mdash;his limbs trembled
with terror! Stone stepped upon the threshold,
and, without speaking, brought his rifle
to his shoulder! Cutler saw that it pointed to
his heart, but he had not the power to speak or
move!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; said Stone, in a low, suppressed
voice, &ldquo;your hour has come, at last!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cutler was by no means a coward; by any
one else he would not have been overcome,
even for an instant. As it was, he soon recovered
himself and sprang forward; but it was
only to fall heavily to the floor; for at the
same moment Stone fired, and the ball passed
directly through his heart! A groan was the
only sound he uttered&mdash;his arm moved, as in
the act of striking, and then fell to the ground&mdash;he
was dead!</p>

<p>The regulators now rushed tumultuously into
the house, and at once seized and pinioned the
three desperadoes; while Stone walked slowly
to the hearth, and resting the breech of his gun
upon the floor, leaned calmly upon its muzzle.
He had heard a scream from above&mdash;a voice
which he knew too well. Margaret had been
aroused from sleep by the report of the gun;
and now, in her night-dress, with her hair
streaming in masses over her shoulders, she
rushed down the rude stairway. The first object
that met her wild gaze was the body of
Cutler, stretched upon the floor and already
stiffening in death. With another loud scream,
she threw herself upon him&mdash;mingling lamentations
for his death, with curses upon his murderers.</p>

<p>Stone's features worked convulsively, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
once or twice his hand grasped the hilt of the
knife which hung at his belt. At last, with a
start, he drew it from the sheath. But, the
next moment, he dashed it into the chimney,
and leaning his gun against the wall, slowly
advanced toward the unhappy woman. Grasping
her arm, he lifted her like a child from the
body to which she clung. Averting his head,
he drew her, struggling madly, to the light;
and having brought her face full before the
lamp, suddenly threw off his cap, and turned
his gaze directly into her eyes. A scream,
louder and more fearful than any before, rang
even to the woods beyond the clearing; she
closed her eyes and shuddered, as if she could
not bear to look upon him, whom she had so
deeply wronged. He supported her on his
arm, and perused her sunken and careworn
features, for many minutes, in silence. Then
slowly relaxing his grasp&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been punished sufficiently,&rdquo; he
said; and seating her gently upon the floor, he
quietly replaced his knife in its sheath, resumed
his rifle, and left the house.</p>

<br />
<p>He was never again seen by any of the parties,
except Margaret. She, soon after this
event, returned to Virginia; and here Stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
paid her an annual visit. He always came without
notice, and departed as suddenly, always
bearing his rifle, and habited as a hunter. At
such times he sought to be alone with her but a
few moments, and never spoke more than three
words: &ldquo;Your punishment continues,&rdquo; he would
say, after gazing at her worn and haggard face
for some minutes; and, then, throwing his rifle
over his shoulder, he would again disappear for
twelve months more.</p>

<p>And truly her punishment <i>did</i> continue; for
though no one accurately knew her history, she
was an object of suspicion to all; and though
she led a most exemplary life, her reputation
was evil, and her misery was but too evident.
One after the other, her children died, and she
was left utterly alone! At last <i>her</i> lamp also
began to flicker, and when Stone arrived in the
country, upon his twelfth annual visit, it was
but to see her die, and follow her to the grave!
He received her last breath, but no one knew
what passed between them in that awful hour.
On the day after her burial he went away and
returned no more.</p>

<br />
<p>The regulators hastily dug a grave on the
bank of the creek, and in the silence of the
night placed Cutler within it. Then, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
possession of the stolen money, they released
their prisoners, notifying them to leave the
country within ten days, and returned to the
east side of the river. A few years ago, a little
mound might be seen, where they had heaped
the dirt upon the unhappy victim of his own
passions. It was &ldquo;<i>the first grave</i>&rdquo; in which a
white man was buried in that part of the Illinois
valley.</p>

<br />
<p>At the expiration of the ten &ldquo;days of grace,&rdquo;
it became the duty of the regulators to see that
their orders had been obeyed; and, though the
death of Cutler had been more than they had
designed or foreseen, they had no disposition to
neglect it. They met, accordingly, on the morning
of the eleventh day, and having chosen a
new leader, proceeded to Cutler's grove. They
found the houses of all those to whom they had
given &ldquo;notice&rdquo; deserted <i>excepting one</i>. This
was the cabin of the youngest of the three
brothers; and declaring his intention to remain,
in defiance of regulators and &ldquo;Lynch law,&rdquo; he
put himself upon his defence. Without ceremony
the regulators set fire to the house in
which he had barricaded himself, and ten
minutes sufficed to smoke him out. They then
discovered what they had not before known:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that his elder brothers were also within; and
when the three rushed from the door, though
taken by surprise, they were not thrown off
their guard. The trio were at once seized, and,
after a sharp struggle, securely pinioned. A
short consultation then decided their course.</p>

<p>Leaving the house to burn at leisure, they
posted away for the river, driving their prisoners
before them, and a march of three hours brought
them to the mouth of the Mauvaisterre. Here
they constructed a &ldquo;raft&rdquo;, by tying half-a-dozen
drift-logs together, and warning them that death
would be the penalty of a return, they placed
their prisoners upon it, pushed it into the middle
of the stream, and set them adrift without oar
or pole! Although this seems quite severe
enough, it was a light punishment compared to
that sometimes administered by regulators; and
in this case, had not blood been spilt when they
did not intend it, it is probable that the culprits
would have been first tied to a tree, and
thoroughly &ldquo;lynched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The involuntary navigators were not rescued
from their unpleasant position until they had
nearly reached Saint Louis; and though they
all swore vengeance in a loud voice, not one of
them was ever again seen in the Sangamon
country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Vigorous measures, like those we have detailed,
were usually effectual in restoring good
order. Where there was no trial, there was no
room for false witnesses; and where a punishment,
not unfrequently disproportioned to the
offence, so rapidly and certainly followed its
commission, there was little prospect of impunity,
and therefore slight inducement to
violate the law. In most localities, it required
but few severe lessons to teach desperadoes that
prudence dictated their emigration; and, it must
be acknowledged, that the regulators were
prompt and able teachers.</p>

<p>But we should give only a partial and incomplete
view of this institution (for such, in fact,
it was), were we to notice its uses and say
nothing of its abuse; because, like everything
else partaking so largely of the mob element, it
was liable to most mischievous perversions.
Had the engine been suffered to rest, when it
had performed its legitimate functions, all would
have been well; but the great vice of the system
was its obstinate vitality: it refused to die
when its life was no longer useful.</p>

<p>As soon as the danger was past, and the call
for his services had ceased, the good citizen,
who alone could confine such a system to its
proper limits, retired from its ranks: it was con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>sequently
left, with all its dangerous authority,
in the hands of the reckless and violent. The
selfish and designing soon filled up the places
of the sober and honest, and from being a terror
to evil-doers, and a protection to the peaceful
citizen, it became a weapon in the hands of the
very men against whom it should have been
directed.</p>

<p>When this came to be the case, the institution
was in danger of doing more harm in its age,
than it had accomplished of good in its youth.
But it must not thence be inferred that it
should never have been adopted, or that it was
vicious in itself. In seasons of public danger,
extraordinary powers are often intrusted to
individuals&mdash;powers which nothing but that
danger can justify, and which would constitute
the dictators intolerable despots, if they were
retained after the crises are passed. The Congress
of our confederacy, for example, found it
necessary, at one period of our Revolutionary
struggle, to invest Washington with such
authority; had he exercised it beyond the
pressure of immediate peril, the same outcry
which has been made against others in similar
circumstances, would have been justly raised
against him. And most men, less soberly constituted
than Washington, would have en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>deavored
to retain it; for power is a pleasant
thing, which few have the self-denial to resign
without a struggle. The wrong consists not in
the original delegation of the authority&mdash;for
that is justified by the highest of all laws, the
law of self-preservation&mdash;but in its retention
and exercise, when the exigency no longer supports
it.</p>

<br />
<p>Having parted with the authority to redress
grievances, and provide for protection and defence,
the citizen can not at once recover it&mdash;it
remains for a time in the hands of the representative,
and is always difficult to regain. But
it does not therefore follow, that he should
never intrust it to another, for the inconvenience
sometimes resulting from its delegation, is
one of the incidents to human life, teaching, not
obstinacy or jealousy, but circumspection.</p>

<br />
<p>The following story, related by one who is
well-acquainted with the early history of this
country, will illustrate the manner in which the
regulator system was sometimes made subservient
to men's selfish purposes; and there have,
unhappily, been too many instances, in which
such criminal schemes were more successful
than they were in this. I have entitled it
&ldquo;The Stratagem.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE STRATAGEM.</h4>

<p>Robert Elwood emigrated from Kentucky to
Illinois, about the year in which the latter was
erected into a state, and passing to the northwest
of the regions then occupied by the French
and Virginians, pitched his tent upon the very
verge of the frontier. He was a man of violent
passions, impatient of the restraints of law&mdash;arrogant,
overbearing, and inclined to the use
of &ldquo;the strong-hand.&rdquo; His removal had been
caused by a difficulty with one of his neighbors,
in which he had attempted to right himself
without an appeal to the legal tribunals. In
this attempt, he had not only been thwarted,
but also made to pay rather roundly for his
temerity; and, vexed and soured, he had at
once abandoned his old name, and marched off
across the prairies, seeking a country in which,
as he said, &ldquo;a man need not meet a cursed constable
every time he left his own door.&rdquo; His
family consisted of three sons and one daughter,
the latter being, at the time of his emigration,
about sixteen years of age.</p>

<br />
<p>In journeying toward the north, he halted
one day, at noon, within a &ldquo;point&rdquo; of timber,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
which extended a mile into the prairie, and
was surrounded by as beautiful a piece of rolling
meadow-land, as one need wish to see. He
was already half-a-day's journey beyond the
thicker settlements; and, indulging a reasonable
hope that he would not speedily be annoyed
by neighbors, he at once determined
here to erect his dwelling and open a new
farm. With this view, he marked off a tract
of about four hundred acres, including the
point of timber in which he was encamped;
and before the heats of summer came on, he
had a cabin ready for his reception, and a considerable
amount of grain planted.</p>

<p>About a mile to the south, there was a similar
strip of timber, surrounded, like that of
which he took possession, by a rich tract of
&ldquo;rolling prairie;&rdquo; and this he at once resolved
to include in his farm. But, reflecting that it
must probably be some years, before any one
else would enter the neighborhood to take it
up&mdash;and having only the assistance of his
sons, but two of whom had reached manhood&mdash;he
turned his attention, first, to the tract
upon which he lived. This was large enough
to engross his efforts for the present; and, for
two years, he neglected to do anything toward
establishing his claim to the land he coveted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
It is true, that he told several of his neighbors,
who had now begun to settle around him, that
he claimed that piece, and thus prevented their
enclosing it; but he neither &ldquo;blazed&rdquo; nor
marked the trees, nor &ldquo;staked off&rdquo; the prairie.</p>

<br />
<p>In the meantime emigration had come in, so
much more rapidly than he had expected, that
he found himself the centre of a populous
neighborhood; and among other signs of advancing
civilization, a company of regulators
had been organized, for the protection of life
and property. Of this band, Elwood, always
active and forward, had been chosen leader;
and the vigor and severity with which he had
exercised his functions, had given a degree of
quiet to the settlements, not usually enjoyed
by these frontier communities. One example
had, at the period of the opening of our story,
but recently been made; and its extreme rigor
had frightened away from the neighborhood,
those who had hitherto disturbed its peace.
This was all the citizens desired; and, having
accomplished their ends, safety and tranquillity,
those whose conservative character had prevented
the regulator system from running into
excesses, withdrew from its ranks&mdash;but took
no measures to have it broken up. It was thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
left, with recognised authority, in the hands of
Elwood, and others of his violent and unscrupulous
character.</p>

<p>Things were in this position, when, on his
return from an expedition of some length, Elwood
bethought him of the handsome tract of
land, upon which he had so long ago set his
heart. What were his surprise and rage on
learning&mdash;a fact, which the absorbing nature
of his regulator-duties had prevented his knowing
sooner&mdash;that it was already in possession
of another! And his mortification was immeasurably
increased, when he was told, that
the man who had thus intruded upon what he
considered his own proper demesne, was none
other than young Grayson, the son of his old
Kentucky enemy! Coming into the neighborhood,
in the absence of Elwood, the young
man, finding so desirable a tract vacant, had at
once taken possession; and by the return of
the regulator had almost finished a neat and
&ldquo;roomy&rdquo; cabin. He had &ldquo;blazed&rdquo; the trees,
too, and &ldquo;staked off&rdquo; the prairie&mdash;taking all
those steps then deemed necessary, on the frontier,
to complete appropriation.</p>

<p>Elwood's first step was to order him peremptorily,
to desist, and give up his &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;&mdash;threatening
him, at the same time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
with certain and uncertain pains and penalties,
if he refused to obey. But Grayson only laughed
at his threats, and went stoutly on with his
work. When the young men, whom he had
hired to assist him in building his house, gave
him a friendly warning, that Elwood was the
leader of a band of regulators, and had power
to make good his menaces, he only replied that
&ldquo;he knew how to protect himself, and, when
the time came, should not be found wanting.&rdquo;
Elwood retired from the contest, discomfited,
but breathing vengeance; while Grayson finished
his house and commenced operations on
his farm. But those who knew the headlong
violence of Elwood's character, predicted that
these operations would soon be interrupted;
and they were filled with wonder, when month
after month passed away, and there were still
no signs of a collision.</p>

<br />
<p>In the meantime, it came to be rumored in
the settlement, that there was some secret connection
between Grayson and Elwood's daughter,
Hannah. They had been seen by several
persons in close conversation, at times and
places which indicated a desire for concealment;
and one person even went so far as to say,
that he had been observed to kiss her, on part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>ing,
late in the evening. Whatever may have
been the truth in that matter, it is, at all events,
certain, that Grayson was an unmarried man;
and that the quarrel between the parents of the
pair in Kentucky, had broken up an intimacy,
which bade fair to issue in a marriage; and it
is probable, that a subordinate if not a primary,
motive, inducing him to take possession of the
disputed land, was a desire to be near Hannah.
Nor was this wish without its appropriate justification;
for, though not strictly beautiful,
Hannah was quite pretty, and&mdash;what is better
in a frontier girl&mdash;active, fresh, and rosy. At
the time of Grayson's arrival in the settlement,
she was a few months past eighteen; and was
as fine material for a border wife, as could be
found in the new state. The former intimacy
was soon renewed, and before the end of two
months, it was agreed that they should be
married, as soon as her father's consent could
be obtained.</p>

<p>But this was not so easily compassed; for,
all this time, Elwood had been brooding over
his defeat, and devising ways and means of
recovering the much-coveted land.</p>

<p>At length, after many consultations with a
fellow named Driscol, who acted as his lieutenant
in the regulator company, he acceded to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
proposition, made long before by that worthy,
but rejected by Elwood on account of its dishonesty.
He only adopted the plan, now, because
it was apparently the only escape from
permanent defeat; and long chafing under
what he considered a grievous wrong, had
made him reckless of means, and determined
on success, at whatever cost.</p>

<br />
<p>One morning, about a week after the taking
of this resolution, it was announced that one of
Elwood's horses had been stolen, on the night
before; and the regulators were straightway
assembled, to ferret out and punish so daring
an offender. It happened (accidently, <i>of
course</i>) to be a horse which had cast one of its
shoes, only the day before; and this circumstance
rendered it easy to discover his trail.
Driscol, Elwood's invaluable lieutenant, discovered
the track and set off upon it, almost as
easily as if he had been present when it was
made. He led the party away into the prairie
toward the east; and though his companions
declared that they could now see nothing of
the trail, the sharp-sighted lieutenant swore
that it was &ldquo;as plain as the nose on his face&rdquo;&mdash;truly,
a somewhat exaggerated expression:
for the color, if not the size, of that feature in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
his countenance, made it altogether too apparent
to be overlooked! They followed him,
however, convinced by the earnestness of his
asseverations, if not by their own eyes, until,
after going a mile toward the east, he began
gradually to verge southward, and, having
wound about at random for some time, finally
took a direct course, for the point of timber on
which Grayson lived!</p>

<p>On arriving at the point, which terminated,
as usual, in a dense hazel-thicket, Driscol at
once pushed his way into the covert, and lo!
there stood the stolen horse! He was tied to a
sapling by a halter, which was clearly recognised
as the property of Grayson, and leading off
toward the latter's house, was traced a man's
footstep&mdash;<i>his</i>, of course! These appearances
fully explained the theft, and there was not a
man present, who did not express a decided
conviction that Grayson was the thief.</p>

<p>Some one remarked that his boldness was
greater than his shrewdness, else he would not
have kept the horse so near. But Driscol declared,
dogmatically, that this was &ldquo;the smartest
thing in the whole business,&rdquo; since, if the trail
could be obliterated, no one would think of
looking <i>there</i> for a horse stolen only a mile
above! &ldquo;The calculation&rdquo; was a good one, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
said, and it only failed of success because he,
Driscol, happened to have a remarkably sharp
sight for all tracks, both of horses and men. To
this proposition, supported by ocular evidence,
the regulators assented, and Driscol stock, previously
somewhat depressed by sundry good
causes, forthwith rose in the regulator market to
a respectable premium!</p>

<p>Having recovered the stolen property, the
next question which presented itself for their
consideration, was in what way they should
punish the thief. To such men as they, this
was not a difficult problem: without much deliberation,
it was determined that he must be at
once driven from the country. The &ldquo;days of
grace,&rdquo; usually given on such occasions, were
ten, and in pursuance of this custom, it was
resolved that Grayson should be mercifully
allowed that length of time, in which to arrange
his affairs and set out for a new home: or, as
the regulators expressed it, &ldquo;make himself
scarce.&rdquo; Driscol, having already, by his praise-worthy
efforts in the cause of right, made himself
the hero of the affair, was invested with
authority to notify Grayson of this decree. The
matter being thus settled, the corps adjourned
to meet again ten days thereafter, in order to see
that their judgment was duly carried into effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime, Driscol, the official mouthpiece
of the self-constituted court of general jurisdiction,
rode away to discharge himself of his
onerous duties. Halting at the low fence which
enclosed the scanty door-yard he gave the customary
&ldquo;Halloo! the house!&rdquo; and patiently
awaited an answer. It was not long, however,
before Grayson issued from the door and advanced
to the fence, when Driscol served the
process of the court <i>in h&aelig;c verba</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grayson, the regulators of this settlement
have directed me to give you ten days'
notice to leave the country. They will meet
again one week from next Friday, and if you
are not gone by that time, it will become their
duty to punish you in the customary way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Grayson, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For stealing this horse,&rdquo; the functionary
replied, laying his hand on the horse's mane,
&ldquo;and concealing him in the timber with the intention
to run him off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's Elwood's horse, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Driscol, somewhat surprised
at Grayson's coolness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was he stolen?&rdquo; asked the notified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; answered the official; &ldquo;I suppose
you know very well without being told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you, indeed?&rdquo; said Grayson, smiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
absently. And then he bent his eyes upon the
ground, and seemed lost in thought for some
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he at length, raising his
eyes again. &ldquo;I didn't steal the horse, Driscol,
but I suppose you regulators know best who
ought to be allowed to remain in the settlement,
so of course I shall have to obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to find you so reasonable,&rdquo; said
Driscol, making a movement to ride away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; said Grayson: &ldquo;don't be in a
hurry! I shall be gone before the ten days are
up, and you and I may not meet again for a
long time, so get down and come in: let us take
a parting drink together. I have some excellent
whiskey, just brought home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the worthy functionary, as we have intimated,
or as the aforesaid nose bore witness,
was &ldquo;quite partial&rdquo; to this description of produce:
some of his acquaintances even insinuating
that he took sometimes &ldquo;a drop too much;&rdquo; and
though he felt some misgiving about remaining
in Grayson's company longer than his official
duties required, the temptation was too strong
for him, and, silencing his fears, he sprang to
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie your horse to the fence, there,&rdquo; said
Grayson, &ldquo;and come in.&rdquo; Driscol obeyed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
it was not long before he was seated in the
cabin with a tin-cup in his hand, and its generous
contents finding their way rapidly down his
capacious throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whiskey is a pleasant drink, after all, isn't
it?&rdquo; said Grayson, smiling at the gusto with
which Driscol dwelt upon the draught, and at
the same moment he rose to set his cup on the
table behind the official.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pleasant indeed,&rdquo; said Driscol, in
reply, and to prove his sincerity, he raised his
cup again to his lips. But this time he was not
destined to taste its contents. It was suddenly
dashed from his hand&mdash;a saddle-girth was
thrown over his arms and body&mdash;and before he
was aware of what was being done, he found
himself securely pinioned to the chair! A rope
was speedily passed round his legs, and tied, in
like manner, behind, so that he could, literally,
move neither hand nor foot! He made a furious
effort to break away, but he would not have
been more secure had he been in the old-fashioned
stocks! He was fairly entrapped, and
though he foamed, and swore, and threatened,
it all did no manner of good. Of this he at
length became sensible, and grinding his teeth
in impotent rage, he relapsed into dogged silence.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly secured his prisoner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Grayson, who was something of a wag, poured
out a small quantity of the seductive liquor, and
coming round in front of the ill-used official,
smiled graciously in his face, and drank &ldquo;a
health&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Success to you, Mr. Driscol,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
long may you continue an ornament to the distinguished
company of which you are an honored
officer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Driscol ground his teeth, but made no reply,
and the toast was drunk, like some of those impressive
sentiments given at public dinners, &ldquo;in
profound silence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having drained the cup, Grayson deposited
it upon the table and himself in a chair; and,
drawing the latter up toward his companion,
opened the conference thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have you pretty safe, Driscol: eh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lieutenant made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you are not in a very sociable humor,&rdquo;
continued Grayson; &ldquo;and, to tell you the truth,
I am not much that way inclined myself: but I
am determined to get to the bottom of this
affair before you shall leave the house. I am
sure you know all about it; and if you don't,
why the worse for you, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Driscol,
speaking for the first time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean this,&rdquo; Grayson answered sternly:
&ldquo;I did not take that horse from Elwood's&mdash;<i>but
you did</i>: I saw you do it. But since my testimony
will not be received, I am determined that
you shall give me a certificate in writing that
such is the fact. You needn't look so obstinate,
for by the God that made us both! you shall not
leave that chair alive, unless you do as I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grayson was a large, rather fleshy man, with
a light complexion and blue eyes; and, though
good-natured and hard to arouse, when once in
earnest, as now, like all men of his stamp, he
both looked, and was, fully capable of carrying
his menaces into execution. The imprisoned
functionary did not at all like the expression of
his eye, he quailed before it in fear and shame.
He was, however, resolved not to yield, except
upon the greatest extremity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Grayson, producing materials
for writing; &ldquo;here are pen, ink, and paper:
are you willing to write as I dictate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Driscol, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll see if I can't make you willing,
then,&rdquo; muttered his captor; and, going to the
other end of the cabin, he took down a coil of
rope, which hung upon a peg, and returned to
his captive. Forming a noose at one end, he
placed it about Driscol's neck, and threw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
other end over a beam which supported the
roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to murder me?&rdquo; demanded
the official in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Grayson, drawing the loose
end down, and tightening the noose about Driscol's
throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll suffer for this,&rdquo; said the lieutenant
furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won't help <i>you</i> much,&rdquo; coolly replied
Grayson, tugging at the rope, until one leg of
the chair gave signs of rising from the floor,
and Driscol's face exhibited unmistakable symptoms
of incipient strangulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a voice reduced
to a mere wheeze&mdash;and Grayson &ldquo;eased
off&rdquo; to hear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't anything else satisfy you but a written
certificate?&rdquo; he asked&mdash;speaking with difficulty,
and making motions as if endeavoring
to swallow something too large to pass the gate
of his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but that,&rdquo; answered Grayson, decidedly;
&ldquo;and if you don't give it to me, when
your regulator friends arrive, instead of me,
they will find you, swinging from this beam by
the neck!&rdquo; And, seeing his victim hesitate, he
again tugged at the rope, until the same signs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
were exhibited as before&mdash;only a little more
apparently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho&mdash;hold, Grayson!&rdquo; begged the frightened
and strangling lieutenant; and, as his executioner
again relaxed a little, he continued:
&ldquo;Just let me up, and I'll do anything you
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; laughed Grayson, &ldquo;you
would rather take the chances of a fight, than
be hung up like a sheep-stealing dog! Let you
up, indeed!&rdquo; And once more he dragged the
rope down more vigorously than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;didn't&mdash;mean that&mdash;indeed!&rdquo; gulped
the unhappy official, this time almost strangled
in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> you mean then?&rdquo; sternly demanded
Grayson, relaxing a little once again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will write the certificate,&rdquo; moaned the
unfortunate lieutenant, &ldquo;if you will let one arm
loose, and won't tell anybody until the ten days
are out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish it kept secret!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I give such a certificate as you demand,&rdquo;
mournfully answered the disconsolate officer,
&ldquo;I shall have to leave the country&mdash;and I
want time to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that's it, is it? Well&mdash;very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About an hour after this, Driscol issued from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the house, and, springing upon the horse, rode
away at a gallop toward Elwood's. Here he
left the animal, but declined to enter; telling
Hannah, who happened to be in the yard, to
say to her father that &ldquo;it was all right,&rdquo; he
pushed on toward home&mdash;tenderly rubbing
his throat, first with the right hand and then
with the left, all the way. Three days afterward,
he disappeared from the settlement, and
was heard of no more.</p>

<p>Grayson waited until near nightfall, and
then took his way, as usual, to a little clump
of trees, that stood near Elwood's enclosures,
to meet Hannah. Here he stayed more than
an hour, detailing the circumstances of the accusation
against him, and laughing with her,
over the ridiculous figure cut by her father's
respectable lieutenant. Before they parted
their plans were all arranged, and Grayson went
home in excellent humor. What these plans
were, will be seen in the sequel.</p>

<br />
<p>Eight days went by without any event important
to our story&mdash;Hannah and Grayson
meeting each evening, in the grove, and parting
again undiscovered. On the ninth day, the
former went to the house of a neighbor, where
it was understood that she was to remain dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>ing
the night, and return home on the following
morning. Grayson remained on his farm
until near sunset, when he mounted his horse
and rode away. This was the last of his &ldquo;days
of grace;&rdquo; and those who saw him passing
along the road, concluded that he had yielded
to the dictates of prudence, and was leaving
the field.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the regulators assembled
to see that their orders had been
obeyed; and, though Elwood was a little disconcerted
by the absence of Driscol, since it
was understood that Grayson had left the
country, the meeting was considered only a
formal one, and the presence of the worthy lieutenant
was not indispensable. They proceeded
in high spirits to the premises, expecting to
find the house deserted and waiting for an occupant.
Elwood was to take immediate possession,
and, all the way across the prairie, was
felicitating himself upon the ease and rapidity
of his triumph. What was their surprise, then,
on approaching the house, to see smoke issuing
from the chimney, as usual&mdash;the door thrown
wide open, and Grayson standing quietly in
front of it! The party halted and a council
was called, but its deliberations were by no
means tedious: it was forthwith determined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
that Grayson stood <i>in defiance of the law</i>, and
must be punished&mdash;that is, &ldquo;lynched&rdquo;&mdash;without
delay! The object of this fierce decree, all
unarmed as he was, still stood near the door,
while the company slowly approached the fence.
He then advanced and addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the ten days are not up yet, gentlemen,&rdquo;
said he mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; answered Elwood quickly;
&ldquo;and we are here to know whether you intend
to obey the authorities, and leave the country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Elwood,&rdquo; said the young man, not
directly replying, &ldquo;this matter can be settled
between you and me, without bloodshed, and even
without trouble. If you will come in with
George and John [his sons], I will introduce
you to my wife, and we can talk it over, with
a glass of whiskey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another consultation ensued, when, in order
to prove their dignified moderation, they agreed
that Elwood and his sons should &ldquo;go in and see
what he had to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elwood, the elder, entered first: directly before
him, holding her sides and shaking with
laughter, stood his rosy daughter, Hannah!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My wife</i>, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Grayson, gravely
introducing them. Hannah's laughter exploded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, father, father, father!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
leaning forward and extending her hands;
&ldquo;ain't you caught, beautifully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh was contagious; and though the
elder knit his brows, and was evidently on the
point of bursting with very different emotions,
his sons yielded to its influence, and, joining
Hannah and her husband, laughed loudly, peal
after peal!</p>

<p>The father could bear it no longer&mdash;he seized
Hannah by the arm and shook her violently, till
she restrained herself sufficiently to speak; as
for him, he was speechless with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's entirely too late to make a 'fuss,' father,&rdquo;
she said at length, &ldquo;for here is the marriage-certificate,
and Grayson is your son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not stolen your horse, Elwood,&rdquo; said
the bridegroom, taking the paper which the
father rejected, &ldquo;though I have run away with
your daughter. And,&rdquo; he added, significantly,
&ldquo;since if you had this land, you would probably
give it to Hannah, I think you and I had better
be friends, and I'll take it as her marriage-portion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can show that you did not take the
horse, Grayson,&rdquo; said George, the elder of the
two sons, &ldquo;I'll answer for that: but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can do very easily,&rdquo; interrupted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
young husband, &ldquo;I have the proof in my
pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught Elwood's eye as he spoke, and reassured
him with a look, for he could see that
the old man began to apprehend an exposure in
the presence of his sons. This forbearance did
more to reconcile him to his discomfiture than
aught else, save the influence of George; for,
like all passionate men, he was easily swayed
by his cooler children. While Hannah and her
brothers examined the marriage certificate, and
laughed over &ldquo;the stratagem,&rdquo; Grayson drew
Elwood aside and exhibited a paper, written in
a cramped, uneven hand, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;This is to certify, that it was not Josiah
Grayson who took Robert Elwood's horse from
his stable, last night&mdash;but I took him myself,
by arrangement, so as to accuse Grayson of the
theft, and drive him to leave his new farm.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thomas Driscol</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Elwood blushed as he came to the words &ldquo;by
arrangement,&rdquo; but read on without speaking.
Grayson then related the manner in which he
had entrapped the lieutenant, and the joke soon
put him in a good humor. The regulators were
called in, and heard the explanation, and all
laughing heartily over the capture of Driscol,
they insisted that Hannah and her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
should mount, and ride with them to Elwood's.
Neither of them needed much persuasion&mdash;the
whole party rode away together&mdash;the &ldquo;lads
and lasses&rdquo; of the neighborhood were summoned,
and the day and night were spent in
merriment and dancing.</p>

<br />
<p>Grayson and his wife returned on the following
morning to their new home, where a life of
steady and honorable industry, was rewarded
with affluence and content. Their descendants
still live upon the place, one of the most beautiful
and extensive farms upon that fertile
prairie. But on the spot where the disputed
cabin stood, has since been built a handsome
brick-house, and I pay only a just tribute to
amiable character, when I say that a more hospitable
mansion is not to be found in the western
country.</p>


<p>This was the last attempt at &ldquo;regulating&rdquo; in
that region, for emigration came in so rapidly,
that the supremacy of the law was soon asserted
and maintained. Whenever this came to be so,
the regulators, of course, ceased to be types of
the state of society, and were succeeded by
other characters and institutions.</p>

<p>To these we must now proceed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenoteb"><p>[<b>NOTE</b>.&mdash;The following is a copy of a compact, such as is
spoken of in the story of the &ldquo;The First Grave,&rdquo; entered into
by a company of regulators in somewhat similar circumstances.
I am not sure that I can vouch for its authenticity, but all who
are familiar with the history of those times, will recognise, in
its peculiarities, the characteristics of the people who then inhabited
this country. The affectation of legal form in such a
document as this, would be rather amusing, were it not quite
too significant; at all events, it is entirely &ldquo;in keeping&rdquo; with
the constitution of a race who had some regard for law and its
vindication, even in their most high-handed acts. The technical
phraseology, used so strangely, is easily traceable to the little
&ldquo;Justice's Form Book,&rdquo; which was then almost the only law
document in the country; and though the words are rather
awkwardly combined, they no doubt gave solemnity to the act

<p>The reign of violence, when an evil at all, is
an evil which remedies itself: the severity of
its proceeding hastens the accomplishment
of its end, as the hottest fire soonest consumes
its fuel. A nation will endure oppression more
patiently immediately after a spasmodic rebellion
or a bloody revolution, than at any other
time; and a community requires less law to
govern it, after a violent and illegal assertion of
the law's supremacy, than was necessary before
the outbreak. After having thrown off the
yoke of a knave&mdash;and perhaps hung the knave
up by the neck, or chopped his head off with
an axe&mdash;mankind not unfrequently fall under
the control of a fool; frightened at their temerity
in dethroning an idol of metal, they bow down
before a paltry statue of wood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Men are not easily satiated with power, but
when it is irregular, a pause in its exercise must
eventually come. And there is a principle of
human nature, which teaches, that whatsoever
partakes of the mob-spirit is, at best, but temporary,
and ought to have a speedy end. This
is especially true of such men as first permanently
peopled the western country; for though
they sometimes committed high-handed and
unjustifiable acts, the moment it was discovered
that they had accomplished the purposes of
order, they allowed the means of vindication to
fall into disuse. The regulator system, for example,
was directed to the stern and thorough
punishment of evil men, but no sooner was
society freed from their depredations, than the
well-meaning citizens withdrew from its ranks;
and, though regulator companies still patrolled
the country, and, for a time, assumed as much
authority as ever, they were not supported by
the solid approbation of those who alone could
give them lasting strength. They did many
outrageous things for which they were never
punished, and for some years, the shield which
the good citizen had raised above his head for
protection and defence, threatened to fall upon
and crush him. But the western people are not
the first who have been temporarily enslaved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
by their liberators, though, unlike many another
race, they waited patiently for the changes of
years, and time brought them a remedy.</p>

<br />
<p>As the government waxed stronger, and
public opinion assumed a direction, the regulators,
like their predecessors, the rangers, found
their &ldquo;occupation gone,&rdquo; and gradually faded
out from the land. Proclamations were issued&mdash;legislatures
met&mdash;laws were enacted, and
officers appointed to execute them; and though
forcing a legal system upon a people who had
so long been &ldquo;a law unto themselves,&rdquo; was a
slow and difficult process, it was powerfully
assisted by the very disorders consequent upon
their attempts at self-government. They had
burnt their hands by seizing the hot iron-rod of
irregular authority, and were, therefore, better
inclined to surrender the baton to those who
could handle it. Like Frankenstein, they had
created a power which they could not immediately
control: the regulators, from being their
servants, had come to be their masters: and
they willingly admitted any authority which
promised deliverance. They had risen in wrath,
and chastised, with no hesitating hand, the
violators of their peace; but the reaction had
taken place, and they were now content to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
governed by whatsoever ruler Providence might
send them.</p>

<p>The state governments were established, then,
without difficulty, and the officers of the new
law pervaded every settlement. The character
which I have selected as the best representative
of this period, is one of these new officers&mdash;<i>the
early justice of the peace.</i></p>

<br />
<p>So far as history or tradition informs us, there
was never yet a country in which appointments
to office were invariably made with reference
only to qualification, and though the west is an
exception to more than one general rule, in this
respect we must set it down in the common category.
The lawyer-period had not yet arrived;
and, probably, there was never an equal number
of people in any civilized country, of whom a
larger proportion were totally ignorant of legal
forms. There were not three in each hundred
who had ever seen the inside of a courthouse,
and they were quite as few who had once looked
upon a law-book! Where such was the case,
some principle of appointment was of course
necessary, other than that which required fitness,
by training, for the office conferred; and it is
probable that the rule adopted was but little
different to that in force among those who have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the appointing power, where no such circumstances
restrict the choice.</p>

<br />
<p>Men were appointed conservators of the
<i>peace</i>, because they had distinguished themselves
in <i>war</i>; and he who had assumed the
powers of the law, as a regulator, was thought
the better qualified to exercise them, as a legal
officer! Courage and capacity, as an Indian-fighter,
gave one the prominence requisite to
his appointment; and zeal for the preservation
of order, exhibited as a self-constituted
judge and executioner, was a guaranty for
the faithful performance of new and regular
duties.</p>

<p>Nor was the rule a bad one. A justice of
the peace chosen upon this principle, possessed
two qualities indispensable to an efficient officer,
in the times of which we write&mdash;he was
prompt in the discharge of his duties, and was
not afraid of responsibility. To obviate the
danger, however, which might arise from these,
he had also a rigid sense of justice, which usually
guided his determinations according to the
rights of parties in interest. This, the lawyers
will say, was a very questionable trait for a
judicial officer; and perhaps it <i>is</i> better for
society, that a judge should know the law, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
administer it without reference to abstract justice,
than that his own notions of right and
wrong should be taken, however conscientiously,
as the standard of judgment: for in that
case, we shall, at least, have uniformity of adjudication;
whereas, nothing is more uncertain,
than a man's convictions of right.</p>

<p>But, in the times of which we are writing,
society was not yet definitely shaped&mdash;its elements
were not bound together by the cohesive
power of any legal cement&mdash;and no better
rule was, therefore, to be expected, than the
spontaneous suggestions of common sense. The
minds of men were, moreover, habituated to a
certain course of thought and action&mdash;(such as
naturally obtains in a new state of society,
where the absence of organization remits them
to their own exertions for safety)&mdash;and it was,
therefore, impossible that any artificial system
should be at once adopted. The people had
been accustomed to such primitive associations,
as they had entered into &ldquo;for the common defence
and general welfare&rdquo; of their infant communities;
the rule of action had been swift, and
sometimes very informal punishment, for every
transgression; and this rule, having very well
answered its purpose, though at the expense
of occasional severity and injustice, they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
not immediately understand the necessity for
any other course of proceeding.</p>

<br />
<p>One of the characteristics of the early justice,
then, was a supreme contempt for all mere
form. He called it &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; and could never
comprehend its utility. To him, all ceremony
was affectation, and the refinements of legal
proceeding were, in his estimation, anti-republican
innovations upon the original simplicity
of mankind. Technicalities he considered merely
the complicated inventions of lawyers, to
exhibit their perverse ingenuity&mdash;traps to
catch the well-meaning or unwary, or avenues
of escape for the guilty. The rules of evidence
he neither understood nor cared for; he desired
&ldquo;to hear all about&rdquo; every cause brought before
him; and the idea of excluding testimony, in
obedience to any rule, he would never entertain.
He acted upon the principle&mdash;though
he probably never heard of the maxim&mdash;that
&ldquo;the law furnishes a remedy for every wrong;&rdquo;
and, if he knew of none in positive enactment,
he would provide one, from the arsenal of his
own sense of right. He never permitted anything
to obstruct the punishment of one whom
he had adjudged guilty; and, rather than allow
a culprit to escape, he would order his judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>ment
to be carried at once into effect, in
the presence, and under the direction of the
court.</p>

<p>He had a strong prejudice against every man
accused of crime; and sometimes almost reversed
the ancient presumption of the law, and
held the prisoner guilty, until he proved himself
innocent. He had unbounded confidence
in the honesty of his neighbors and friends, and
was unwilling to believe, that they would accuse
a man of crime or misdemeanor, without
very good cause. When it was proven that a
crime <i>had been committed</i>, he considered the
guilt of the prisoner already half established:
it was, in his judgment, what one, better acquainted
with legal terms, might have called
&ldquo;a <i>prima facia</i> case,&rdquo; devolving the <i>onus probandi</i>
(or burthen of proof) upon the accused.
And this may have been one cause of the frequent
resort to <i>alibis</i>&mdash;a mode of defence
which, as we have already remarked, is even
yet in great disrepute. If a defence, of some
sort, was not, then, very clearly and satisfactorily
made out, the justice had no hesitation
in entering judgment, and ordering immediate
punishment; for the right of appeal was not
generally recognised, and the justice took original
and final jurisdiction, where now his duties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
are merely those of preliminary examination
and commitment.</p>

<br />
<p>In civil controversies&mdash;where such causes
were presented for adjudication, which, however,
was not very often&mdash;the order of proceeding
was quite as summary. The justice
heard the statements of the parties, and sometimes,
not always, would listen to witnesses,
also; then, taking the general &ldquo;rights, interests,
claims, and demands,&rdquo; of both sides into
consideration&mdash;and viewing himself, not as a
judicial officer, but as a sort of referee or arbitrator&mdash;he
would strike a balance between the
disputants, and dismiss them to their homes,
with a significant admonition to &ldquo;keep the
peace.&rdquo; He usually acted upon the principle&mdash;no
very erroneous one, either&mdash;that, when
two respectable men resort to the law, as arbitrator
of their controversies, they are both about
equally blamable; and his judgments were
accordingly based upon the corollary, that
neither deserved to have all he claimed. This
was the practice when any decision was made
at all; but, in most cases, the justice acted as
a pacificator, and, by his authority and persuasion,
induced the parties to agree upon a compromise.
For this purpose, he not unfrequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ly
remitted both fees and costs&mdash;those due to
the constables, as well as his own.</p>

<p>An instance of this pacific practice has been
related to me as follows: Two neighbors had
quarrelled about a small amount of debt, and,
after sundry attempts to &ldquo;settle,&rdquo; finally went
to law. The justice took them aside, on the day
of trial, and proposed a basis of settlement, to
which they agreed, <i>on condition</i>, that all costs
should be remitted, and to this the magistrate
at once pledged himself. But a difficulty arose:
the constable, who had not been consulted in
the arrangement, had had a long ride after the
defendant, and having an unquestionable right
to demand his fees, was unwilling to give them
up. The justice endeavored to prevail with him
by persuasion, but in vain. Finally, growing
impatient of his obstinacy, he gave him a
<i>peremptory order</i> to consent, and, on his refusal,
<i>fined him</i> the exact amount of his fees <i>for contempt</i>,
entered up judgment on the basis of the
compromise, and adjourned the court!</p>

<p>The man who thus discourages litigation at
the expense of his own official emoluments, may
be forgiven a few irregularities of proceeding,
in consideration of the good he effects; for
although under such a system it was seldom
that either party obtained his full and just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
rights, both were always benefited by the spirit
of peace infused into the community. It
would, perhaps, be well for the country now,
were our legal officers actuated by the same
motives; unfortunately, however, such men
belong only to primitive times.</p>

<br />
<p>But the love of peace was not accompanied,
in this character, as it usually is, by merciful
judgment, for, as he was very swift in determining
a prisoner's guilt, he was equally rigid
in imposing the penalty. The enactments of
the criminal code were generally so worded as
to give some scope for the exercise of a compassionate
and enlightened discretion; but when
the decision lay in the breast of our justice, if
he adjudged any punishment at all, it was
usually the severest provided for by the statute.
Half-measures were not adapted to the temper
of the times or the character of the people;
indeed, they are suited to <i>no</i> people, and are
signal failures at all times, in all circumstances.
Inflicting light punishments is like firing blank
cartridges at a mob, they only irritate, without
subduing; and as the latter course usually ends
in unnecessary bloodshed, the former invariably
increases the amount of crime.</p>

<p><i>Certainty</i> of punishment may be&mdash;unques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>tionably
<i>is</i>&mdash;a very important element in the
administration of justice, but as nothing so
strongly disinclines a man to entering the water
as the sight of another drowning, so nothing
will so effectually deter him from the commission
of crime, as the knowledge that another
has been severely punished for yielding to the
same temptation. The justice, however, based
the rigor of his judgments upon no such argument
of policy. His austerity was a part of
his character, and had been rendered more
severe by the circumstances in which he had
lived&mdash;the audacity of law-breakers, and the
necessity for harsh penalties, in order for protection.</p>

<br />
<p>It will be observed that I say nothing of
juries, and speak of justices of the peace, as
officers having authority to decide causes alone.
And, it must be recollected, that in the days of
which I am writing, resort was very seldom had
to this cumbersome and uncertain mode of adjudication.
In civil causes, juries were seldom
empanelled, because they were attended by very
considerable expense and delay. The chief object,
in going to law, moreover, was, in most
cases, to have <i>a decision</i> of the matter in dispute;
and juries were as prone to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
as now. Suitors generally, therefore, would
rather submit to the arbitration of the justice,
than take the risk of delay and uncertainty,
with a jury. In criminal causes, the case was
very similar: the accused would as lief be
judged by one prejudiced man as by twelve;
for the same rigorous spirit which actuated the
justice, pervaded also the juries; and (besides
the chance of timidity or favor in the justice)
in the latter he must take the additional risks
of personal enmity and relationship to the party
injured. Thus, juries were often discarded in
criminal causes also, and we think their disuse
was no great sacrifice. Such a system can
derive its utility, in this country, only from an
enlightened public sentiment: if that sentiment
be capricious and oppressive, as it too often is,
juries are quite as likely to partake its vices as
legal officers: if the sentiment be just and
healthy, no judicial officer dare be guilty of
oppression. So that our fathers lost nothing in
seldom resorting to this &ldquo;palladium of our
liberties,&rdquo; and, without doubt, gained something
by avoiding delay, uncertainty, and expense.</p>

<p>The reader will also observe, that I say
nothing of higher courts. But the lines between
the upper and lower tribunals were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
so strictly drawn then as they now are, and the
limits of jurisdiction were, consequently, very
indefinite. Most of the characteristics, moreover,
here ascribed to the justice of the peace,
belonged, in almost an equal degree, to the
judges of the circuit courts; and, though some
of the latter were men of respectable legal requirements,
the same off-hand mode of administering
the law which distinguished the
inferior magistrates, marked the proceedings of
their courts also. Both occasionally assumed
powers which they did not legally possess; both
were guided more by their own notions of justice,
than by the rules of law; and both were
remarkable for their severity upon all transgressors.
Neither cared much for the rules of
evidence, each was equal to any emergency or
responsibility, and both had very exalted ideas
of their own authority.</p>

<p>But the functions of the justice were, in his
estimation, especially important&mdash;his dignity
was very considerable also, and his powers anything
but circumscribed. A few well-authenticated
anecdotes, however, will illustrate the
character better than any elaborate portraiture.
And, for fear those I am about to relate may
seem exceptions, not fairly representing the
class, I should state, in the outset, that I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
selected them from a great number which I can
recall, particularly because they are <i>not</i> exceptive,
and give a very just impression of the
character which I am endeavoring to portray.</p>

<br />
<p>Squire A&mdash;&mdash; was a plain, honest farmer,
who had distinguished himself as a pioneer and
ranger, and was remarkable as a man of undoubted
courage, but singularly peaceable temper.
In the year eighteen hundred and twenty,
he received from Governor Bond of Illinois, a
commission as justice of the peace, and though
he was not very clear what his duties, dignities,
and responsibilities, precisely were, like a patriot
and a Roman, he determined to discharge them
to the letter. At the period of his appointment,
he was at feud with one of his neighbors about
that most fruitful of all subjects of quarrel, a
division-fence; and as such differences always
are, the dispute had been waxing warmer for
several months. He received his docket, blanks,
and &ldquo;Form-Book,&rdquo; on Saturday evening, and
though he had as yet no suits to enter and no
process to issue, was thus provided with all the
weapons of justice. On the following Monday
morning, he repaired, as usual, to his fields,
about half-a-mile from home, and though full
of his new dignity, went quietly to work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not been there long, before his old
and only enemy made his appearance, and
opened upon him a volley of abuse in relation
to the division-fence, bestowing upon his honor,
among other expressive titles, the euphonious
epithet of &ldquo;jackass.&rdquo; A&mdash;&mdash; bore the attack
until it came to this point&mdash;which, it would
seem, was as far as a man's patience ought to
extend&mdash;and, it is probable, that had he not
been a legal functionary, a battle would have
ensued &ldquo;then and there.&rdquo; But it was beneath
the dignity thus outraged, to avenge itself by a
vulgar fisticuff, and A&mdash;&mdash; bethought him of a
much better and more honorable course. He
threw his coat across his arm, and marched
home. There he took down his new docket,
and upon the first page, recorded the case of
the &ldquo;<i>People of the State of Illinois</i> vs. <i>John
Braxton</i>&rdquo; (his enemy). He then entered up the
following judgment: &ldquo;<i>The defendant in this
case, this day, fined ten dollars and costs, for</i>
<span class="smcap">contempt of court</span>, <i>he having called</i> <span class="smcap">us</span> <i>a jackass</i>!&rdquo;
On the opposite page is an entry of
satisfaction, by which it appears that he forthwith
issued an execution upon the judgment,
and collected the money!</p>

<p>This pretext of &ldquo;contempt&rdquo; was much in
vogue, as a means of reaching offences not ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>pressly
provided for by statute; but the justice
was never at a loss for expedients, even in cases
entirely without precedent, as the following
anecdote will illustrate:&mdash;</p>

<br />
<p>A certain justice, in the same state of Illinois,
was one day trying, for an aggravated assault, a
man who was too much intoxicated fully to
realize the import of the proceedings or the
dignity of the court. He was continually interrupting
witnesses, contradicting their testimony,
and swearing at the justice. It soon
became evident that he must be silenced or the
trial adjourned. The justice's patience at length
gave way. He ordered the constable to take
the obstreperous culprit to a creek, which ran
near the office, &ldquo;and duck him until he was
sober enough to be quiet and respect the court!&rdquo;
This operation the constable alone could not
perform, but in due time he brought the defendant
back dripping from the creek and
thoroughly sobered, reporting, at the same time,
that he had availed himself of the assistance
of two men, Messrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and L&mdash;&mdash;, in the
execution of his honor's commands. The trial
then went quietly on, the defendant was fined
for a breach of the peace, and ordered to pay
<i>the costs</i>: one item of which was two dollars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to Messrs. B&mdash;&mdash; and L&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;for assisting the
constable in ducking the prisoner!&rdquo; But, as
the justice could find no form nor precedent for
hydropathic services, he entered the charge as
&ldquo;<i>witness fees</i>,&rdquo; and required immediate payment!
The shivering culprit, glad to escape on
any terms, paid the bill and vanished!</p>

<br />
<p>Whatever might have been the prevailing
opinion, as to the legality of such a proceeding,
the ridicule attaching to it would effectually
have prevented any remedy&mdash;most men being
willing to forgive a little irregularity, for the
sake of substantial justice and &ldquo;a good joke.&rdquo;
But the summary course, adopted by these
magistrates, sometimes worked even greater
injustice&mdash;as might have been expected; and
of this, the following is an example:&mdash;</p>

<p>About the year eighteen hundred and twenty-six,
there lived, in a certain part of the west,
a man named Smedley, who, so far as the collection
of debts was concerned, was entirely
&ldquo;law-proof.&rdquo; He seemed to have a constitutional
indisposition to paying anything he
owed: and, though there were sundry executions
in the hands of officers against him&mdash;and
though he even seemed thrifty enough in
his pecuniary affairs&mdash;no property could ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
be found, upon which they could be levied.
There was, at the same time, a constable in the
neighborhood, a man named White, who was
celebrated, in those days of difficult collections,
for the shrewdness and success of his official
exploits; and the justice upon whom he usually
attended, was equally remarkable, for the high
hand with which he carried his authority. But,
though two executions were placed in the
hands of the former, upon judgments on the
docket of the latter, months passed away, without
anything being realized from the impervious
defendant, Smedley.</p>

<p>Whenever the constable found him in possession
of property, and made a levy, it was
proven to belong to some one else; and the
only result of his indefatigable efforts, was the
additions of heavy costs to the already hopeless
demand.</p>

<p>At length, however, White learned that Smedley
had <i>traded horses</i> with a man named Wyatt,
and he straightway posted off to consult the
magistrate. Between them, the plan of operations
was agreed upon. White levied first
upon the horse then in the possession of Smedley,
taking him under <i>one</i> of the two writs: he
then levied <i>the other</i> execution upon the horse
which Smedley had traded to Wyatt. The lat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ter,
apprehending the loss of his property,
claimed the first horse&mdash;that which he had
traded to Smedley. But, upon the &ldquo;trial of the
right of property,&rdquo; the justice decided that the
horse was found in the possession of Smedley,
and was, therefore, subject to levy and sale.
He was accordingly sold, and the first judgment
was satisfied. Wyatt then claimed the
<i>second</i> horse&mdash;that which he had received
from Smedley. But, upon a similar &ldquo;trial&rdquo;&mdash;after
severely reprimanding Wyatt for claiming
<i>both</i> horses, when, on his own showing, he
never owned but <i>one</i>&mdash;the justice decided
that the property in dispute had been in the
possession of Smedley at the rendition of the
judgment, and was therefore, like the other,
subject to a lien, and equally liable to levy and
sale! And accordingly, this horse, also, was
sold, to satisfy the second execution, and Wyatt
was dismissed by the justice, with no gentle
admonition, &ldquo;to be careful in future with whom
he swapped horses!&rdquo; A piece of advice which
he probably took, and for which he ought to
have been duly grateful! Fallen humanity,
however, is very perverse; and it is at least
supposable, that, having lost his horse, he considered
himself hardly used&mdash;an opinion in
which my legal readers will probably concur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving this part of my subject, I will
relate another anecdote, which, though it refers
more particularly to constables, serves to illustrate
the characteristics of the early officers of
the law&mdash;justices, as well as others:&mdash;</p>

<p>The constable who figured so advantageously
in the anecdote last related, had an execution
against a man named Corson, who was almost
as nearly &ldquo;law proof&rdquo; as Smedley. He had
been a long time endeavoring to realize something,
but without success. At length, he was
informed, that Corson had sued another man,
upon an account, before a justice in a distant
part of the same county. This, the delinquent
officer at once saw, gave him a chance to secure
something; and, on the day of trial, away he
posted to the justice's office. Here, he quietly
seated himself, and watched the course of the
proceeding. The trial went on, and, in due
time, the justice decided the cause in favor of
Corson. At this juncture, White arose, and,
while the justice was entering up judgment,
approached the table. When the docket was
about to be laid aside, he interposed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said he, placing his hand upon the
docket, &ldquo;<i>I levels on this judgment</i>!&rdquo; And,
giving no attention to remonstrances, he demanded
and obtained the execution. On this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
he collected the money, and at once applied it
to that, which he had been so long carrying&mdash;thus
settling two controversies, by diligence
and force of will. He was certainly a valuable
officer!</p>

<br />
<p>Thus irregular and informal were many of
the proceedings of the primitive legal functionaries;
but a liberal view of their characters
must bring us to the conclusion, that their influence
upon the progress of civilization of the
country, was, on the whole, decidedly beneficial.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Previous to the organization of civil government,
and &ldquo;the form and pressure&rdquo; given to the
times by this and its attendant circumstances,
the primitive tastes and habits of the western
people, excluded many of those artificial wants
which are gratified by commerce, and afforded
no room for traders, excepting those who sold
the absolute necessaries of life.</p>

<p>In those days, housekeeping was a very simple
matter. Neither steam-engines nor patent
cook-stoves were yet known, as necessary adjuncts
to a kitchen; the housewife would have
&ldquo;turned up her nose&rdquo; in contempt of a bake-oven:
would have thrown a &ldquo;Yankee reflector&rdquo;
over the fence, and branded the innovator with
the old-fashioned gridiron. Tin was then supposed
to be made only for cups and coffee-pots:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
pie-pans had not yet even entered &ldquo;the land of
dreams;&rdquo; and the tea-kettle, which then &ldquo;sang
songs of family glee,&rdquo; was a quaint, squat
figure, resembling nothing so much as an over-fed
duck, and poured forth its music from a
crooked, quizzical spout, with a notch in its iron
nozzle. If its shut-iron lid was ornamented
with a brass button, for a handle, it was thought
to be manufactured in superior style. Iron
spoons were good enough for the daintiest
mouth; and a full set of pewter was a household
treasure. China dishes and silver plate
had been heard of, but belonged to the same
class of marvellous things, with Aladdin's lamp
and Fortunatus's purse. Cooking was not yet
reduced to a science, and eating was like sleep&mdash;a
necessity, not a mere amusement. The
only luxuries known, were coffee and sugar;
and these, with domestics and other cotton
fabrics, were the chief articles for which the
products of the earth were bartered.</p>

<p>French cloths and Parisian fashions were
still less known than silver spoons and &ldquo;rotary
stoves.&rdquo; The men wore homemade jeans, cut
after the <i>mode</i> of the forest: its dye a favorite
&ldquo;Tennessean&rdquo; brownish-yellow; and the women
were not ashamed to be seen in linsey-wolsey,
woven in the same domestic loom. Knitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
was then not only an accomplishment, but a
useful art; and the size which a &ldquo;yarn&rdquo; stocking
gave to a pretty ankle, was not suffered to
overbalance the consideration of its comfort.
The verge of nakedness was not then the region
of modesty: the neck and its adjacent parts
were covered in preference to the hands; and,
in their barbarous ignorance, the women thought
it more shame to appear in public half-dressed,
than to wear a comfortable shoe.</p>

<p>They were certainly a very primitive people&mdash;unrefined,
unfashionable, &ldquo;coarse&rdquo;&mdash;and many
of their sons and daughters are even now
ashamed to think what &ldquo;savages&rdquo; their parents
were! In their mode of life, they sought comfort,
not &ldquo;appearances;&rdquo; and many things which
their more sophisticated descendants deem
necessaries, they contemned as luxuries.</p>

<br />
<p>But, in the course of time, these things began
to change, for simplicity is always &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo;
and the progress of refinement is only the multiplication
of wants. As the country was reduced
to cultivation, and peace settled upon its
borders, new classes of emigrants began to take
possession of the soil; and, for the immediate
purposes of rapid advancement, and especially
of social improvement, they were better classes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
than their predecessors: for, as the original
pioneers had always lived a little beyond the
influences of regular civilization, these had remained
within its limits until the pressure of
legal organization began to grow irksome to
their partially untamed spirits. There was, indeed,
an unbroken gradation of character, from
the nearly savage hunter, who visited the
country only because it was uninhabited, except
by wild beasts, to the genuine <i>citizen</i>, who
brought with him order, and industry, and legal
supremacy.</p>

<p>The emigrants, of whom we are now writing,
constituted the third step in this progression;
and they imported along with them, or drew
after them, the peculiarities belonging to their
own degree of advancement. Their notions of
comfort and modes of living, though still quite
crude, indicated an appreciable stage of refinement.
They were better supplied, for example,
with cooking utensils&mdash;their household furniture
was not so primitive&mdash;and in wearing apparel,
they manifested some regard to elegance
as well as comfort. Social intercourse disseminated
these ideas among those to whom they
were novel; where, previously, the highest
motive to improvement had been a desire for
convenience, the idea of gentility began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
claim an influence; and some of the more
moderate embellishments of life assumed the
place of the mere necessaries.</p>

<p>The transition was not rapid nor violent, like
all permanent changes, it was the work of
years, marked by comparatively slow gradations.
First, tin-ware, of various descriptions,
became necessary to the operations of the
kitchen; and that which had been confined to
one or two articles, was now multiplied into
many forms. A housewife could no more bake
a pie without a &ldquo;scalloped&rdquo; pie-pan, than without
a fire: a tin-bucket was much more easily
handled than one of cedar or oak; and a pepper-box,
of the same material, was as indispensable
as a salt-cellar. A little tea was occasionally
added to the ancient regimen of coffee, and
thus a tin-canister became necessary for the
preservation of the precious drug. With tea
came queensware: and half-a-dozen cups and
saucers, usually of a dingy white, with a raised
blue edge, were needful for the pranking of the
little cupboard.</p>

<br />
<p>But it was not only in the victualing department
that the progress of refinement could be traced;
for the thrifty housewife, who thought it proper
to adorn her table, and equip her kitchen with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
all the late improvements, could not, of course,
entirely overlook &ldquo;the fashions:&rdquo; the decoration
of her person has been, in all ages, the just and
honest pride of woman. Linsey-wolsey began
to give place to calicoes and many-colored
prints; calf-skin shoes were antiquated by the
use of kid; and ribands fluttered gracefully
upon new-fashioned bonnets. Progress of this
kind never takes a step backward: once possessed
of an improvement in personal comfort,
convenience, or adornment, man&mdash;or woman&mdash;seldom
gives it up. Thus, these things, once
used, thenceforth became wants, whose gratification
was not to be foregone: and it is one of
the principles governing commerce, that the
demand draws to it the supply.</p>

<p>There were few &ldquo;country stores,&rdquo; in those
days, and the settlements were so scattered as
to make it sometimes very inconvenient to visit
them. From ten to twenty miles was a moderate
distance to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of supplies; and a
whole day was usually consumed in going and
returning. The visits were, therefore, not very
frequent&mdash;the purchases for many weeks&mdash;perhaps
months&mdash;being made on each occasion.
This was a very inconvenient mode of
&ldquo;shopping,&rdquo; even for the energetic women of
that day; and, since the population would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
justify more numerous &ldquo;stores,&rdquo; it was desirable
that some new system should be introduced,
capable of supplying the demand at the cost of
less trouble, and fewer miles of travel. To
answer this necessity there was but one way&mdash;the
&ldquo;storekeeper&rdquo; must carry his wares to the
doors of his customers. And thus arose the
occupation of the <i>Peddler</i>, or, as he called
himself, the &ldquo;travelling merchant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The population of the country was then almost
exclusively agricultural&mdash;the mechanic
arts belong to a more advanced period. The
consequence was, that the first articles carried
about from house to house, were such as are
manufactured by artisans&mdash;and the chief of
these was tin-ware.</p>

<p>The tinkers of the rural districts in older
countries, were, however, not known in this&mdash;they
were not adapted to the genius of the people.
The men who sold the ware were, scarcely
ever, the same who made it; and, though the
manual dexterity of most of these ready men,
might enable them to mend a broken pan, or a
leaky coffeepot, their skill was seldom put in
requisition. Besides, since the mending of an
old article might interfere with the sale of a
new one, inability to perform the office was
more frequently assumed than felt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of time&mdash;as the people of the
country began to acquire new ideas, and discover
new wants&mdash;other articles were added
to the peddler's stock. Calicoes were often carried
in the same box with tin pans&mdash;cotton
checks and ginghams were stowed away beneath
tin-cups and iron-spoons&mdash;shining coffee-pots
were crammed with spools of thread,
papers of pins, cards of horn-buttons, and cakes
of shaving-soap&mdash;and bolts of gaudy riband
could be drawn from pepper-boxes and sausage-stuffers.
Table-cloths, of cotton or brown linen,
were displayed before admiring eyes, which
had turned away from all the brightness of
new tin plates; and knives and forks, all &ldquo;warranted
pure steel,&rdquo; appealed to tastes, which
nothing else could excite. New razors touched
the men &ldquo;in tender places,&rdquo; while shining
scissors clipped the purses of the women. Silk
handkerchiefs and &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; neckcloths&mdash;things
till then unknown&mdash;could occupy the former,
while the latter covetously turned over and examined
bright ribands and fresh cotton hose.
The peddler was a master of the art of pleasing
all tastes: even the children were not forgotten;
for there were whips and jew's-harps for
the boys, and nice check aprons for the girls.
(The taste for &ldquo;playing mother&rdquo; was as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
an instinct, with the female children of that
day, as it is in times more modern; but life
was yet too earnest to display it in the dressing
and nursing of waxen babies.) To suit the
people from whom the peddler's income was derived,
he must consult at least the appearance
of utility, in every article he offered; for,
though no man could do more, to coax the
money out of one's pocket, without leaving an
equivalent, even <i>he</i> could not succeed in such
an enterprise, against the matter-of-fact pioneer.</p>

<br />
<p>The &ldquo;travelling merchants&rdquo; of this country
were generally what their customers called
&ldquo;Yankees&rdquo;&mdash;that is, New-Englanders, or descendants
of the puritans, whether born east
of the Hudson or not. And, certainly, no class
of men were ever better fitted for an occupation,
than were those for &ldquo;peddling.&rdquo; The
majority of them were young men, too; for the
&ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; who lives beyond middle age, without
providing snug quarters for the decline of
life, is usually not even fit for a peddler. But,
though often not advanced in years, they often
exhibited qualities, which one would have expected
to find only in men of age and experience.
They could &ldquo;calculate,&rdquo; with the most
absolute certainty, what precise stage of ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>vancement
and cultivation, was necessary to
the introduction of every article of merchandise
their stock comprised. Up to a certain limit,
they offered, for example, linen table-cloths:
beyond that, cotton was better and more saleable;
in certain settlements, they could sell
numbers of the finer articles, which, in others,
hung on their hands like lead; and they seemed
to know, the moment they breathed the air of
a neighborhood, what precise character of goods
was most likely to pay.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;by way of illustration&mdash;it might
seem, to one not experienced in reading the
signs of progress, a matter of nice speculation
and subtle inquiry, to determine what exact
degree of cultivation was necessary, to make
profitable the trade in <i>clocks</i>. But I believe
there is no instance of an unsuccessful clock-peddler
on record; and, though this fact may
be accounted for, superficially, by asserting
that time is alike important to all men, and a
measure of its course, therefore, always a want,
a little reflection will convince us, that this explanation
is more plausible than sound.</p>

<br />
<p>It is, perhaps, beyond the capacity of any
man, to judge unerringly, by observation, of
the usual signs of progress, the exact point at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
which a community, or a man, has arrived in
the scale of cultivation; and it may seem especially
difficult, to determine commercially,
what precise articles, of use or ornament, are
adapted to the state indicated by those signs.
But that there are such indications, which, if
properly attended to, will be unfailing guides,
is not to be denied. Thus, the quick observation
of a clock-peddler would detect among a
community of primitive habits, the growing
tendency to regularity of life; for, as refinement
advances, the common affairs of everyday
existence, feeling the influence first, assume
a degree of order and arrangement; and from
the display of this improvement, the trader
might draw inferences favorable to his traffic.
Eating, for example, as he would perceive, is
done at certain hours of the day&mdash;sleep is
taken between fixed periods of the night and
morning&mdash;especially, public worship&mdash;which
is one of the best and surest signs of social advancement&mdash;must
be held at a time generally
understood.</p>

<p>The peddler might conclude, also, when he
saw a glazed window in a house, that the owner
was already possessed of a clock&mdash;which, perhaps,
needed repairing&mdash;or, at least, was in
great need of one, if he had not yet made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
purchase. One of these shrewd &ldquo;calculators&rdquo;
once told me, that, when he saw a man with
four panes of glass in his house, and no clock,
he either sold him one straightway, or &ldquo;set
him down crazy, or a screw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no other 'signs of promise'&rdquo;? I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;many! For instance:
When I am riding past a house&mdash;(I always
ride slowly)&mdash;I take a general and particular
survey of the premises&mdash;or, as the military
men say, I make a <i>reconnaissance</i>; and it must
be a very bare place, indeed, if I can not see
some 'sign,' by which to determine, whether
the owner needs a clock. If I see the man,
himself, I look at his extremities; and by the
appearance of hat and boot, I make up my
opinion as to whether he knows the value of
time: if he wears anything but a cap, I can
pretty fairly calculate upon selling him a clock;
and if, to the hat, he has added <i>boots</i>, I halt at
once, and, without ceremony, carry a good
one in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I see the wife, instead of the husband,
I have no difficulty in making up my
mind&mdash;though the signs about the women are
so numerous and minute, that it would be hard
to explain them. If one wears a check-apron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and sports a calico dress, I know that a 'travelling
merchant' has been in the neighborhood;
and if he has succeeded in making a reasonable
number of sales, I am certain that he
has given her such a taste for buying, that I
can sell her anything at all: for purchasing
cheap goods, to a woman, is like sipping good
liquor, to a man&mdash;she soon acquires the appetite,
and thenceforward it is insatiable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some customers who have a <i>passion</i>
for clocks. There is a man on this road, who
has one for every room in his house; and I
have another with me now&mdash;with a portrait of
General Jackson in the front&mdash;which I expect
to add to his stock. There is a farmer not far
from here, with whom I have 'traded' clocks
every year since I first entered the neighborhood&mdash;always
receiving about half the value
of the article I sell, in money, 'to boot.'
There are clock-fanciers, as well as fanciers of
dogs and birds; and I have known cases, in
which a man would have two or three time-pieces
in his house, and not a pair of shoes in
the family! But such customers are rare&mdash;as
they ought to be; and the larger part of our
trade is carried on, with people who begin to
feel the necessity of regularity&mdash;to whom the
sun has ceased to be a sufficient guide&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
who have acquired some notions of elegance
and comfort. And we seldom encounter the
least trouble in determining, by the general appearance
of the place, whether the occupant has
arrived at that stage of refinement.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>We perceive that the principal study of the
peddler is human nature; and though he classifies
the principles of his experience, more
especially with reference to the profits of his
trade, his rapid observation of minor traits and
indications, is a talent which might be useful in
many pursuits, besides clock-peddling. And,
accordingly, we discover that, even after he
has abandoned the occupation, and ceased to be
a bird of passage, he never fails to turn his
learning to a good account.</p>

<br />
<p>He was distinguished by energy as well as
shrewdness, and an enterprising spirit was the
first element of his prosperity. There was no
corner&mdash;no secluded settlement&mdash;no out-of-the
way place&mdash;where he was not seen. Bad roads
never deterred him: he could drive his horses and
wagon where a four-wheeled vehicle never went
before. He understood bearings and distances
as well as a topographical engineer, and would
go, whistling contentedly, across a prairie or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
through a forest, where he had not even a
&ldquo;trail&rdquo; to guide him. He could find fords and
crossings where none were previously known to
exist; and his pair of lean horses, by the skilful
management of their driver, would carry
him and his wares across sloughs and swamps,
where a steam-engine would have been clogged
by the weight of a baby-wagon. If he broke
his harness or his vehicle in the wilderness, he
could repair it without assistance, for his mechanical
accomplishments extended from the
shoeing of a horse to the repair of a watch, and
embraced everything between. He was never
taken by surprise&mdash;accidents never came unexpected,
and strange events never disconcerted
him. He would whistle &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo;
while his horses were floundering in a quagmire,
and sing &ldquo;Hail Columbia&rdquo; while plunging
into an unknown river!</p>

<p>He never met a stranger, for he was intimately
acquainted with a man as soon as he
saw him. Introductions were useless ceremonies
to him, for he cared nothing about names.
He called a woman &ldquo;ma'am&rdquo; and a man &ldquo;mister,&rdquo;
and if he could sell either of them a few
goods, he never troubled himself or them with
impertinent inquiries. Sometimes he had a
habit of learning each man's name from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
next neighbor, and possessing an excellent
memory, he never lost the information thus
acquired.</p>

<p>When he had passed through a settlement
once, he had a complete knowledge of all its
circumstances, history, and inhabitants; and,
the next year, if he met a child in the road, he
could tell you whom it most resembled, and to
what family it belonged. He recollected all
who were sick on his last visit&mdash;what peculiar
difficulties each was laboring under&mdash;and was
always glad to hear of their convalescence. He
gathered medicinal herbs along the road, and
generously presented them to the housewives
where he halted, and he understood perfectly
the special properties of each. He possessed a
great store of good advice, suited to every
occasion, and distributed it with the disinterested
benevolence of a philanthropist. He knew
precisely what articles of merchandise were
adapted to the taste of each customer; and the
comprehensive &ldquo;rule of three&rdquo; would not have
enabled him to calculate more nicely the exact
amount of &ldquo;talk&rdquo; necessary to convince them
of the same.</p>

<p>His address was extremely insinuating, for he
always endeavored to say the most agreeable
things, and no man could judge more accurately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
what would best please the person addressed.
He might be vain enough, but his egotism was
never obtruded upon others. He might secretly
felicitate himself upon a successful trade, but
he never boasted of it. He seemed to be far
more interested in the affairs of others than in
his own. He had sympathy for the afflictions
of his customers, counsel for their difficulties,
triumph in their success.</p>

<br />
<p>Before the introduction of mails, he was the
universal news-carrier, and could tell all about
the movements of the whole world. He could
gossip over his wares with his female customers,
till he beguiled them into endless purchases, for
he had heard of every death, marriage, and
birth within fifty miles. He recollected the
precise piece of calico from which Mrs. Jones
bought her last new dress, and the identical
bolt of riband from which Mrs. Smith trimmed
her &ldquo;Sunday bonnet.&rdquo; He knew whose children
went to &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; in &ldquo;store-shoes,&rdquo; whose
daughter was beginning to wear long dresses,
and whose wife wore cotton hose. He could
ring the changes on the &ldquo;latest fashions&rdquo; as
glibly as the skilfulest <i>modiste</i>. He was a
<i>connoisseur</i> in colors, and learned in their
effects upon complexion. He could laugh the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
husband into half-a-dozen shirts, flatter the wife
into calico and gingham, and praise the children
till both parents joined in dressing them anew
from top to toe.</p>

<p>He always sold his goods &ldquo;at a ruinous
sacrifice,&rdquo; but he seemed to have a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of
infinite extent and capacity, from which he
annually drew new supplies. He invariably
left a neighborhood the loser by his visit, and
the close of each season found him inconsolable
for his &ldquo;losses.&rdquo; But the next year he was sure
to come back, risen, like the Ph&#339;nix, from his
own ashes, and ready to be ruined again&mdash;in
the same way. He could never resist the pleading
look of a pretty woman, and if she &ldquo;jewed&rdquo;
him twenty per cent. (though his profits were
only two hundred), the tenderness of his heart
compelled him to yield. What wonder is it,
then, if he was a prime favorite with all the
women, or that his advent, to the children, made
a day of jubilee?</p>

<br />
<p>But the peddler, like every other human
&ldquo;institution,&rdquo; only had &ldquo;his day.&rdquo; The time
soon came when he was forced to give way
before the march of newfangledness. The
country grew densely populated, neighborhoods
became thicker, and the smoke of one man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
chimney could be seen from another's front-door.
People's wants began to be permanent&mdash;they
were no longer content with transient
or periodical supplies&mdash;they demanded something
more constant and regular. From this
demand arose the little neighborhood &ldquo;stores,&rdquo;
established for each settlement at a central and
convenient point&mdash;usually at &ldquo;cross-roads,&rdquo; or
next door to the blacksmith's shop&mdash;and these
it was which superseded the peddler's trade.</p>

<br />
<p>We could wish to pause here, and, after describing
the little d&eacute;p&ocirc;t, &ldquo;take an account of
stock:&rdquo; for no store, not even a sutler's, ever
presented a more amusing or characteristic
assortment. But since these modest establishments
were generally the <i>nuclei</i>, around which
western towns were built, we must reserve our
fire until we reach that subject.</p>


<p>But the peddler had not acquired his experience
of life for nothing, he was not to be outdone,
even by the more aristocratic stationary
shop-keeper. When he found his trade declining,
he cast about him for a good neighborhood,
still uninvaded by the Lombards, and his
extensive knowledge of the country soon enabled
him to find one. Here he erected his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
cabin, and boldly entered the lists against his
new competitors. If he could find no eligible
point for such an establishment, or if he augured
unfavorably of his success in the new walk, he
was not cast down. If he could not &ldquo;keep
store,&rdquo; he could at least &ldquo;keep tavern,&rdquo; an
occupation for which his knowledge of the
world and cosmopolitan habits, admirably fitted
him. In this capacity, we shall have occasion
to refer to him again; and have now only to
record, that in the progress of time, he grew
rich, if not fat, and eventually died, &ldquo;universally
regretted.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">THE SCHOOLMASTER.</span></div>

<p>In the progress of society, the physical wants
are felt before the intellectual. Men appreciate
the necessity for covering their backs and
lining their stomachs before storing their minds,
and they naturally provide a shelter from the
storms of heaven, before they seek (with other
learning) a knowledge of the heavenly bodies.
Thus the rudest social system comprises something
of the mechanic arts&mdash;government begins
to advance toward the dignity of a science&mdash;commerce
follows the establishment of legal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>supremacy&mdash;and the education of the citizen
comes directly after the recognition of his social
and political rights. So, the justice of the
peace (among other legal functionaries) indicates
subjection, more or less complete, to the
regulations of law; the peddler represents the
beginning of commercial interests; and the
schoolmaster succeeds him, in the natural order
of things.</p>

<p>It may be possible to preserve a high respect
for a <i>calling</i>, while we despise the men who
exercise it: though I believe this is not one of
the rules which &ldquo;work both ways,&rdquo; and the converse
is, therefore, not equally true. A man's
occupation affects <i>him</i> more nearly than <i>he</i>
does his occupation. A thousand contemptible
men will not bring a respectable profession into
so much disrepute, as a contemptible profession
will a thousand respectable men. All the military
talents, for example, of the commander-in-chief
of our armies, would not preserve him
from contempt, should he set up a barber-shop,
or drive a milk-cart; but the barber, or the
milkman, might make a thousand blunders at
the head of an army, should extravagant democracy
elevate him to that position, and yet the
rank of a general would be as desirable, because
as honorable, as ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>It is certainly true, however, that the most
exalted station may be degraded by filling it
with a low or despicable incumbent, for the
mental effort necessary to the abstraction of the
employment from him who pursues it, is one
which most men do not take the trouble to
make: an effort, indeed, which the majority of
men are <i>incapable</i> of making. A vicious priest
degrades the priestly vocation&mdash;a hypocrite
brings reproach upon the religious profession&mdash;a
dishonest lawyer sinks the legal character&mdash;and
even the bravest men care but little for
promotion in an army, when cowardice and incompetency
are rewarded with rank and power.
But manifest incapacity, culpable neglect of
duty, or even a positively vicious character,
will not reduce a calling to contempt, or bring
it into disrepute so soon, as any quality which
excites ridicule.</p>

<p>An awkward figure, a badly-shaped garment,
or an ungainly manner, will sometimes outweigh
the acquirements of the finest scholar;
and the cause of religion has suffered more,
from the absence of the softer graces, in its
clerical representations, than from all the logic
of its adversaries. A laugh is more effectual
to subvert an institution, than an argument&mdash;for
it is easier to make men ashamed, than to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
convince them. Truth and reason are formidable
weapons, but ridicule is stronger than
either&mdash;or both.</p>

<p>Thus: All thinking men will eagerly admit,
that the profession of the schoolmaster is, not
only respectable, but honorable, alike to the individual,
and to the community in which he
pursues it: yet, rather than teach a school for a
livelihood, the large majority of the same men
would &ldquo;split rails&rdquo; or cut cord-wood! And this
is not because teaching is laborious&mdash;though it
<i>is</i> laborious, and thankless, too, beyond all
other occupations; but because a number and
variety of causes, into which we need not inquire,
have combined to throw ridicule upon
him, who is derisively called the pedagogue&mdash;for
most men would rather be shot at, than
laughed at. Cause and effect are always inter-reactive:
and the refusal of the most competent
men, to &ldquo;take up the birch&rdquo;&mdash;which is
the effect of this derision&mdash;has filled our
school-rooms with men, who are, not unfairly,
its victims. Thus the profession&mdash;(for such is
its inherent dignity)&mdash;itself, has fallen into discredit&mdash;even
though the judgment of men
universally is, that it is not only useful, but indispensable.</p>

<p>Nor is that judgment incorrect. For, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
home-education may sometimes succeed, it is
usually too fragmentary to be beneficial&mdash;private
tutors are too often the slaves of their pupils,
and can not enforce &ldquo;attention,&rdquo; the first
condition of advancement, where they have not
the paraphernalia of command&mdash;and, as for
self-education, logically there can be no such
thing: &ldquo;one might as well attempt to lift himself
over the fence, by the straps of his boots,&rdquo;
as to educate himself &ldquo;without a master.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>The schoolmaster, then, is a useful member
of society&mdash;not to be spared at any stage of its
progress. But he is particularly necessary to
communities which are in the transition state;
for, upon the enlightenment of the rising generation
depend the success and preservation of
growing institutions. Nor does his usefulness
consist altogether&mdash;or even in a great measure&mdash;in
the number of facts, sciences, or theories,
with which he may store the minds of his pupils.
These are not the objects of education,
any more than a knowledge of the compartments
in a printer's &ldquo;letter-case,&rdquo; is the ultimate
result of the art of printing. The types
are so arranged, in order to enable the compositors
more conveniently to attain the ends,
for which that arrangement is only a prepara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>tion:
facts and sciences are taught for the improvement
of the faculties, in order that they
may work with more ease, force, and certainty,
upon other and really important things; for
education is only the marshalling of powers,
preliminary to the great &ldquo;battle of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mind of an uneducated man, however
strong in itself, is like an army of undisciplined
men&mdash;a crowd of chaotic, shapeless, and often
misdirected elements. To bring these into
proper subjection&mdash;to enable him to bind
them, with anything like their native force, to
a given purpose&mdash;a prescribed &ldquo;training&rdquo; is
necessary; and it is this which education supplies.
If you can give a mind the <i>habit of attention</i>,
all the power it has will be made
available: and it is through this faculty, that
even dull minds are so frequently able to
mount the car of triumph, and ride swiftly
past so many, who are immeasurably their
superiors. The first element of the discipline
which develops this power, is submission to
control; and without such subordination, a
school can not exist. Thus, the first lesson
that children learn from the schoolmaster, is
the most valuable acquisition they can make.</p>

<br />
<p>But it was no easy task to teach this princi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ple
to the sturdy children of the early Western
&ldquo;settler;&rdquo; in this, as in all other things, the
difficulty of the labor was in exact proportion
to its necessity. The peculiarities of the people,
and the state of the country, were not
favorable to the establishment of the limited
monarchy, requisite to successful teaching. In
the first place, the parents very generally undervalued,
what they called &ldquo;mere book-learning.&rdquo;
For themselves, they had found more
use for a rifle than a pen; and they naturally
thought it a much more valuable accomplishment,
to be able to scalp a squirrel with a
bullet, at a hundred paces, than to read the
natural history of the animal in the &ldquo;picture-book.&rdquo;
They were enthusiastic, also, upon the
subject of independence; and, though they
could control their children sternly enough at
home, they were apt to look, with a jealous eye,
upon any attempt to establish dominion elsewhere.
The children partook largely of the
free, wild spirit of their fathers. They were
very prompt to resist anything like encroachment
upon their privileges or rights, and were,
of course, pretty certain to consider even salutary
control an attempt to assert a despotism.
I believe history contains no record, whatever
the annals of fiction may display, of a boy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with much spirit, submitting without a murmur
to the authority of the schoolmaster: if such a
prodigy of enlightened humility ever existed,
he certainly did not live in the west. But a
more important difficulty than either of these,
was the almost entire want of money in the
country; and without this there was but little
encouragement for the effort to overcome other
obstacles. Money <i>may</i> be only a <i>representative</i>
of value, but its absence operates marvellously
like the want of the value itself, and the primitive
people of those days, and especially that
class to which the schoolmaster belonged, had
a habit, however illogical, of considering it a
desirable commodity, <i>per se.</i></p>

<p>All these impediments, however, could, in the
course of time, be conquered: the country was
improving in social tone; parents must eventually
take some pride even in the accomplishments
they despised; and patience and gentleness,
intermingled, now and then, with a little
wholesome severity, will ultimately subdue the
most stubborn spirit. As for the pecuniary
difficulty, it was, as the political economists
will tell us, only the absence of a medium at
the worst: and, in its stead, the master could
receive boarding, clothing, and the agricultural
products of the country. So many barrels of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
corn, or bushels of wheat, &ldquo;per quarter,&rdquo; might
not be so conveniently handled, but were quite
as easy to be counted, as an equal number of
dollars; and this primitive mode of payment is
even yet practised in many rural districts, perhaps,
in both the east and west. To counter-balance
its inconvenience of bulk, this &ldquo;currency&rdquo;
possessed a double advantage over the
more refined &ldquo;medium of exchange&rdquo; now in
use: it was not liable to counterfeits, and the
bank from which it issued was certain not to
&ldquo;break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the schoolmaster was not to be deterred
from pursuing his honorable calling, even by
the difficulties incident to half-organized communities.
Indeed, teaching was the resort, at least
temporary, of four fifths of the educated, and
nearly an equal number of the uneducated
young men, who came to the west: for certainly
that proportion of both classes arrived in the
country, without money to support, friends to
encourage, or pride to deter them.</p>

<br />
<p>They were almost all what western people
call &ldquo;Yankees&rdquo;&mdash;born and bred east of the
Hudson: descendants of the sturdy puritans&mdash;and
distinguished by the peculiarities of that
strongly-marked people, in personal appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ance,
language, manners, and style and tone of
thought. Like the peddlers, they were generally
on the sunny side of thirty, full of the
hopeful energy which belongs to that period of
life, and only submitting to the labors and
privations of the present, because through these
they looked to the future for better and brighter
things.</p>

<p>The causes which led to their emigration,
were as many and as various as the adventurers
whom they moved. They were, most of them,
mere boys: young Whittingtons, whom the
bells did <i>not</i> ring back, to become lord-mayors;
who, indeed, had not even the limited possessions
of that celebrated worthy; and, thus destitute,
they wandered off, many hundreds of
miles, &ldquo;to see the world and make their fortunes,&rdquo;
at an age when the youth of the present
day are just beginning to think of college.
They brought neither money, letters of introduction,
nor bills of exchange: they expected
to find neither acquaintance nor relatives. But
they knew&mdash;for it was one of the wise maxims
of their unromantic fathers&mdash;that industry and
honesty must soon gather friends, and that all
other desirable things would speedily follow.
They had great and just confidence in their own
abilities to &ldquo;get along;&rdquo; and if they did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
actually think that the whole world belonged to
them, they were well-assured, that in an incredibly
short space of time, they would be
able to possess a respectable portion of it.</p>

<br />
<p>A genuine specimen of the class to which
most of the early schoolmasters belonged, never
felt any misgivings about his own success, and
never hesitated to assume any position in life.
Neither pride nor modesty was ever suffered to
interfere with his action. He would take charge
of a numerous school, when he could do little
more than write his own name, just as he would
have undertaken to run a steamboat, or command
an army, when he had never studied
engineering or heard of strategy. Nor would
he have failed in either capacity: a week's application
would make him master of a steam-engine,
or a proficient (after the <i>present manner</i>
of proficiency) in tactics; and as for his school,
he could himself learn at night what he was to
teach others on the following day! Nor was
this mere &ldquo;conceit&rdquo;&mdash;though, in some other
respects, that word, in its limited sense, was
not inapplicable&mdash;neither was it altogether
ignorant presumption; for one of these men
was seldom known to fail in anything he undertook:
or, if he did fail, he was never found to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
be cast down by defeat, and the resiliency of
his nature justified his confidence.</p>

<br />
<p>The pursuit of a certain avocation, for a long
period, is apt to warp one's nature to its inequalities;
and as the character gradually
assumes the peculiar shape, the personal appearance
changes in a corresponding direction
and degree. Thus, the blacksmith becomes
brawny, square, and sturdy, and the characteristic
swing of his arm gives tone to his whole
bearing: the silversmith acquires a peering,
cunning look, as if he were always examining
delicate machinery: the physician becomes
solemn, stately, pompous, and mysterious, and
speaks like &ldquo;Sir Oracle,&rdquo; as if he were eternally
administering a bread-pill, or enjoining a regimen
of drugs and starvation: the lawyer
assumes a keen, alert, suspicious manner, as if
he were constantly in pursuit of a latent perjury,
or feared that his adversary might discover
a flaw in his &ldquo;case:&rdquo; and so on, throughout the
catalogue of human avocations. But, among
all these, that which marks its votaries most
clearly, is school-teaching.</p>

<p>There seems to be a sort of antagonism
between this employment and all manner of
neatness, and the circle of the schoolmaster's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
female acquaintance never included the Graces.
Attention to personal decoration is usually,
though not universally, in an inverse ratio
to mental garniture; and an artistically-tied
cravat seems inconsistent with the supposition
of a well-stored head above it. A mind which
is directed toward the evolution of its own
powers, has but little time to waste in adorning
the body; and a fashionable costume would
appear to cramp the intellect, as did the iron-vessel
the genius of the Arabian tale. Although,
therefore, there are numerous exceptions&mdash;persons
whose externals are as elegant as their
pursuits are intellectual&mdash;men of assiduously-cultivated
minds are apt to be careless of appearances,
and the principle applies, with especial
force, to those whose business it is to develop
the minds of others.</p>

<p>Nor was the schoolmaster of early days in
the west, an exception to the rule. He might
not be as learned, nor as purely intellectual, as
some of our modern college-professors, but he
was as ungraceful, and as awkwardly clad, as
the most slovenly of them all. Indeed, he came
of a stock which has never been noted for any
of the lighter accomplishments, or &ldquo;carnal
graces;&rdquo; for at no period of its eventful history,
has the puritan type been a remarkable elegant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
one. The men so named have been better
known for bravery than taste, for zeal than
polish; and since there is always a correspondence
between habits of thought and feeling
and the external appearance, the <i>physique</i> of
the race is more remarkable for rigor of muscle
and angularity of outline, than for accuracy of
proportion or smoothness of finish. Neither
Apollo nor Adonis was in any way related to
the family; and if either had been, the probability
is that his kindred would have disowned
him.</p>

<p>Properly to represent his lineage, therefore,
the schoolmaster could be neither dandy nor
dancing-master; and, as if to hold him to his
integrity, nature had omitted to give him any
temptation, in his own person, to assume either
of these respectable characters. The tailor that
could shape a coat to fit <i>his</i> shoulders, never
yet handled shears; and he would have been as
ill at ease, in a pair of fashionable pantaloons,
as if they had been lined with chestnut-burrs.
He was generally above the medium height,
with a very decided stoop, as if in the habit of
carrying burthens; and a long, high nose, with
light blue eyes, and coarse, uneven hair, of a
faded weather-stain color, gave his face the
expression answering to this lathy outline.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Though never very slender, he was always thin:
as if he had been flattened out in a rolling-mill;
and rotundity of corporation was a mode of
development not at all characteristic. His complexion
was seldom florid, and not often decidedly
pale; a sort of sallow discoloration was
its prevailing hue, like that which marks the
countenance of a consumer of &ldquo;coarse&rdquo; whiskey
and strong tobacco. But these failings were
not the cause of his cadaverous look&mdash;for a
faithful representative of the class held them
both in commendable abhorrence&mdash;<i>they were
not the vices of his nature.</i></p>

<p>There was a sub-division of the class, a secondary
type, not so often observed, but common
enough to entitle it to a brief notice. <i>He</i> was,
generally, short, square, and thick&mdash;the latitude
bearing a better proportion to the longitude than
in his lank brother&mdash;but never approaching
anything like roundness. With this attractive
figure, he had a complexion of decidedly bilious
darkness, and what is commonly called a &ldquo;dish-face.&rdquo;
His nose was depressed between the
eyes, an arrangement which dragged the point
upward in the most cruel manner, but gave it
an expression equally ludicrous and impertinent.
A pair of small, round, black eyes, encompassed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>&mdash;like
two little feudal fortresses, each by its
moat&mdash;with a circle of yellowish white, peered
out from under brows like battlements. Coarse,
black hair, always cut short, and standing erect,
so as to present something the appearance of
a <i>chevaux de frise</i>, protected a hard, round
head&mdash;a shape most appropriate to his lineage&mdash;while,
with equal propriety, ears of corresponding
magnitude stood boldly forth to assert
their claim to notice.</p>

<p>Both these types were distinguished for large
feet, which no boot could enclose, and hands
broad beyond the compass of any glove. Neither
was ever known to get drunk, to grow fat, to
engage in a game of chance, or to lose his appetite:
it became the teacher of &ldquo;ingenuous
youth&rdquo; to preserve an exemplary bearing before
those whom he was endeavoring to benefit;
while respectable &ldquo;appearances,&rdquo; and proper
appreciation of the good things of life, were
the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> of his system of morality.</p>

<br />
<p>But the schoolmaster&mdash;and we now include
both sub-divisions of the class&mdash;was not deficient
as an example in many other things, to all who
wished to learn the true principles of living.
Among other things, he was distinguished for
a rigid, iron-bound economy: a characteristic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
which it might have been well to impart to
many of his pupils. But that which the discreet
master denominated <i>prudence</i>, the extravagant
and wrong-headed scholar was inclined to term
<i>meanness</i>: and historical truth compels us to
admit, that the rigor of grim economy sometimes
wore an aspect of questionable austerity.
Notwithstanding this, however, when we reflect
upon the scanty compensation afforded the
benefactor of the rising generation, we can not
severely blame his penurious tenacity any more
than we can censure an empty wine-cask for not
giving forth the nectar which we have never
poured into it. If, accordingly, he was out at
the elbows, we are bound to conclude that it
was because he had not the money to buy a new
coat; and if he never indulged himself in any
of the luxuries of life, it was, probably, because
the purchase of its necessaries had already
brought him too near the bottom of his purse.</p>

<p>He was always, moreover, &ldquo;a close calculator,&rdquo;
and, with a wisdom worthy of all imitation,
never mortgaged the future for the convenience
of the present. Indeed, this power
of &ldquo;calculation&rdquo; was not only a talent but a
passion: you would have thought that his progenitors
had been arithmeticians since the time
of Noah! He could &ldquo;figure up&rdquo; any proposi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>tion
whatsoever: but he was especially great
upon the question, how much he could save
from his scanty salary, and yet live to the end
of the year.</p>

<p>In fact, it was only <i>living</i> that he cared for.
The useful, with him, was always superior to
the ornamental; and whatever was not absolutely
necessary, he considered wasteful and
extravagant. Even the profusion of western
hospitality was, in his eyes, a crime against the
law of prudence, and he would as soon have
forgiven a breach of good morals as a violation
of this, his favorite rule.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, he carried this
principle with him into the school-room, and was
very averse to teaching anything beyond what
would certainly &ldquo;pay.&rdquo; He rigidly eschewed
embellishment, and adorned his pupils with no
graceful accomplishments. It might be that he
never taught anything above the useful branches
of education, because he had never learned
more himself; but it is certain that he would
not have imparted merely polite learning, had
his own training enabled him to do so: for he
had, constitutionally, a high contempt for all
&ldquo;flimsy&rdquo; things, and, moreover, he was not employed
or paid to teach rhetoric or <i>belles-lettres</i>,
and, &ldquo;on principle,&rdquo; he never gave more in re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>turn
than the value of the money he received.</p>

<p>With this reservation, his duties were always
thoroughly performed, for neither by nature,
education, nor lineage, was he likely to slight
any recognised obligation. He devoted his time
and talents to his school, as completely as if he
had derived from it the income of a bishop; and
the iron constitution, of both body and mind, peculiar
to his race, enabled him to endure a greater
amount of continuous application than any other
man. Indeed, his powers of endurance were
quite surprising, and the fibre of his mind was
as tough as that of his body. Even upon a
quality so valuable as this, however, he never
prided himself; for, excepting the boast of race,
which was historical and not unjustifiable, he
<i>had</i> no pride. He might be a little vain; and,
in what he said and did, more especially in its
manner, there might occasionally be a shade of
self-conceit: for he certainly entertained no
mean opinion of himself. This might be a little
obtrusive, too, at times; for he had but slight
veneration for men, or their feelings, or opinions;
and he would sometimes pronounce a judgment
in a tone of superiority justly offensive. But
he possessed the uncommon virtue of sincerity:
he thoroughly believed in the infallibility of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
own conclusions; and for this the loftiness of
his tone might be forgiven.</p>

<p>The most important of the opinions thus expressed,
were upon religious subjects, for Jews,
puritans, and Spaniards, have always been very
decided controversialists. His theology was
grim, solemn, and angular, and he was as
combative as one of Cromwell's disputatious
troopers. In his capacious pocket, he always
carried a copy of the New Testament&mdash;as, of
old, the carnal controvertists bore a sword
buckled to the side. Thus armed, he was a
genuine polemical &ldquo;swash-buckler,&rdquo; and would
whip out his Testament, as the bravo did his
weapon, to cut you in two without ceremony.
He could carve you into numerous pieces, and
season you with scriptural salt and pepper; and
he would do it with a gusto so serious, that it
would have been no unreasonable apprehension
that he intended to eat you afterward. And
the value of his triumph was enhanced, too, by
the consideration that it was won by no meretricious
graces or rhetorical flourishes; for the
ease of his gesticulation was such as you see in
the arms of a windmill, and his enunciation was
as nasal and monotonous as that of the Reverend
Eleazar Poundtext, under whose ministrations
he had been brought up in all godliness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>But he possessed other accomplishments beside
those of the polemic. He was not, it is
true, overloaded with the learning of &ldquo;the
schools&rdquo;&mdash;was, in fact, quite ignorant of some
of the branches of knowledge which he imparted
to his pupils: yet this was never allowed
to become apparent, for as we have intimated,
he would frequently himself acquire, at night,
the lessons which he was to teach on the
morrow. But time was seldom wasted among
the people from whom he sprang, and this want
of preparation denoted that his leisure hours
had been occupied in possessing himself of other
acquirements. Among these, the most elegant,
if not the most useful, was music, and his
favorite instrument was the flute.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; Dickens describes
a certain flute-playing tutor, by the name of
Mell, concerning whom, and the rest of mankind,
he expresses the rash opinion, &ldquo;after
many years of reflection,&rdquo; that &ldquo;nobody ever
could have played worse.&rdquo; But Dickens never
saw Strongfaith Lippincott, the schoolmaster,
nor heard his lugubrious flute, and he therefore
knows nothing of the superlative degree of detestable
playing.</p>

<p>There <i>are</i> instruments upon which even an
unskilful performer may make tolerable music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
but the flute is not one of them&mdash;the man who
murders <i>that</i>, is a malefactor entitled to no
&ldquo;benefit of clergy:&rdquo; and our schoolmaster <i>did</i>
murder it in the most inhuman manner! But,
let it be said in mitigation of his offence, he had
never received the benefit of any scientific
teaching&mdash;he had not been &ldquo;under the tuition
of the celebrated Signor Wheeziana,&rdquo; nor had
he profited by &ldquo;the invaluable instructions of
the unrivalled Bellowsblauer&rdquo;&mdash;and it is very
doubtful whether he would have gained much
advantage from them, had he met the opportunity.</p>

<p>He knew that, in order to make a noise on
the flute, or, indeed, anywhere else, it was
necessary to <i>blow</i>, and blow he did, like Boreas!
He always carried the instrument in his pocket,
and on being asked to play&mdash;a piece of politeness
for which he always looked&mdash;he drew it
out with the solemnity of visage with which a
tender-hearted sheriff produces a death-warrant,
and while he screwed the joints together, sighed
blasts like a furnace. He usually deposited
himself upon the door-sill&mdash;a favorite seat for
him&mdash;and collecting the younger members of
the family about him, thence poured forth his
strains of concentrated mournfulness.</p>

<p>He invariably selected the most melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
tunes, playing, with a more profound solemnity,
the gloomiest psalms and lamentations. When
he ventured upon secular music, he never performed
anything more lively than &ldquo;The Mistletoe
Bough,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Barbara Allen,&rdquo; and into each
he threw a spirit so much more dismal than the
original, as almost to induce his hearers to
imitate the example of the disconsolate &ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;turn their faces to the wall&rdquo; in
despair of being ever again able to muster a
smile!</p>

<p>He was not a scientific musician, then&mdash;fortunately
for his usefulness&mdash;because thorough
musicians are generally &ldquo;good-for-nothing&rdquo;
else. But music was not a science among the
pioneers, though the undertone of melancholy
feeling, to which all sweet sounds appeal, was
as easily reached in them as in any other people.
Their wants in this, as in other things, were very
easily satisfied&mdash;they were susceptible of pleasure
from anything which was in the least commendable:
and not feeling obliged, by any
captious canon, to condemn nine true notes, because
of the tenth false one, they allowed themselves
to enjoy the best music they could get,
without thinking of the damage done their
musical and critical reputation.</p>

<p>But his flute was not the only means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
pleasing within the schoolmaster's reach: for
he could flatter as well as if the souls of ten
courtiers had transmigrated into his single body.
He might not do it quite so gracefully as one
of these, nor with phrases so well-chosen, or so
correctly pronounced, but what he said was
always cunningly adapted to the character of
the person whom he desired to move. He had
&ldquo;a deal of candied courtesy,&rdquo; especially for the
women; and though his sturdy manhood and
the excellent opinion of himself&mdash;both of which
came to him from his ancestry&mdash;usually preserved
him from the charge of servility, he was
sometimes a &ldquo;cozener&rdquo; whose conscience annoyed
him with very few scruples. Occasionally
he might be seen fawning upon the rich; but it
was not with him&mdash;as it usually is with the
parasites of wealthy men&mdash;because he thought
Dives more respectable, but more <i>useful</i>, on
account of his money: the opulent possessed
what the indigent wanted, and the shortest road
to the goal of Cupidity, lay through the region
of Vanity. There was none of that servility
which Mr. Carlyle has attempted to dignify with
the name of &ldquo;hero-worship,&rdquo; for the rich man
was rather a bird to be plucked, than a &ldquo;hero&rdquo;
to be worshipped. And though it may seem
that I do the schoolmaster little honor by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
distinction, I can not but think cupidity a more
manly trait than servility: the beast of prey a
more respectable animal than the hound.</p>

<p>But the schoolmaster's obsequiousness was
more in manner than in inclination, and found
its excuse in the dependence of his circumstances.
It has been immemorially the custom
of the world, practically to undervalue his services,
and in all time teaching and poverty have
been inseparable companions. Nobody ever
cared how poorly he was clad, how laborious
his life, or how few his comforts; and if he
failed to attend to his own interests by all
the arts in his power, no one, certainly, would
perform the office for him. He was expected to
make himself generally useful without being
particular about his compensation: he was willing
to do the one, but was, very naturally,
rather averse to the other: that which justice
would not give him, he managed to procure by
stratagem.</p>

<p>His manners thus acquired the characteristics
we have enumerated, with also others. He was,
for example, very officious; a peculiarity which
might, perhaps, be derived from his parentage,
but which was never repressed by his occupation.
The desire to make himself agreeable,
and his high opinion of his ability to do so, ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>dered
his tone and bearing very familiar; but
this was, also, a trait which he shared with his
race, and one which has contributed, as much
as any other, to bring the people called
&ldquo;Yankees&rdquo; into contempt in the west. The
men of that section are not themselves reserved,
and hate nothing more than ceremonious politeness:
but they like to be the first to make advances,
and their demonstrations are all hearty,
blunt, and open. They therefore disliked anything
which has an insinuating tone, and the
man who attempts to ingratiate himself with
them, whether it be by elaborate arts or sidelong
familiarity, at once arms them against them.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster was inquisitive, also, and
to that western men most decidedly object.
They have little curiosity themselves, and seldom
ask impertinent questions. When they do so,
it is almost always for the purpose of insulting
the man to whom they are put, and <i>never</i> to
make themselves agreeable. The habit of asking
numerous questions was, therefore, apt to
prejudice them against men whose characteristics
might be, in other respects, very estimable;
and it must be acknowledged, that vulgar and
obtrusive impertinence is an unfortunate accompaniment
to an introduction. But the schoolmaster
never meant to be impertinent, for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
was far from being quarrelsome (except with his
scholars), and the idea that any one could be
otherwise than pleased with his notice, however
given, never entered his mind. Though his
questions were, for the most part, asked to
gratify a constitutional curiosity, he was actuated
in some degree, also, by the notion that
his condescension would be acceptably interpreted
by those whom he thus favored. But,
like many other benevolent men, who put force
upon their inclinations for the benefit of their
neighbors, he was mistaken in his &ldquo;calculation;&rdquo;
and where he considered himself a benefactor,
he was by others pronounced a &ldquo;bore.&rdquo; The
fact is, he had some versatility, and, like most
men of various powers, he was prone to think
himself a much greater man than he really was.</p>

<p>He was not peculiarly fitted to shine as a
gallant &ldquo;in hall or bower,&rdquo; but had he been the
climax of knightly qualities, the very impersonation
of beauty, grace, and accomplishment,
he could not have been better adapted than, in
his own estimation, he already was, to please
the fancy of a lady. He was blissfully unconscious
of every imperfection; and displayed
himself before what he thought the admiring
gaze of all <i>dames</i> and <i>demoiselles</i>, as proudly
as if he had been the all-accomplished victor in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
some passage of arms. Yet he carried himself,
in outward appearance, as meekly as the humblest
Christian, and took credit to himself accordingly.
He seldom pressed his advantages
to the utter subjugation of the sighing dames,
but deported himself with commendable forbearance
toward the weak and defenceless whom
his perfections had disarmed. He was as merciful
as he was irresistible: as considerate as he
was beautiful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;What a saint of a knight is the knight of Saint John!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The personal advantages which he believed
made him so dangerous to the peace of woman,
were counteracted, thus, by his saintly piety.
For&mdash;as it became him to be, both in the character
of a man, and in that of a descendant of
the puritans&mdash;he was always habited in &ldquo;the
livery of heaven.&rdquo; Some ill-natured and suspicious
people, it is true, were inclined to call
his exemplary &ldquo;walk&rdquo; hypocritical, and to stigmatise
his pious &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; as <i>cant</i>. But
the ungodly world has always persecuted the
righteous, and the schoolmaster was correct in
attributing their sneers to the rebuke which his
example gave to their wickedness, and to make
&ldquo;capital&rdquo; out of the &ldquo;persecution.&rdquo; And who
shall blame him&mdash;when in the weary intervals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of a laborious and thankless profession, fatigue
repressed enthusiasm&mdash;if he sometimes eked
out the want of inspiration by a godly snuffle?
True piety reduces even the weapons of the
scorner to the service of religion, and the citadel
of the Gloomy Kingdom is bombarded with the
artillery of Satan! Thus, the nose, which is so
serviceable in the production of the devilish and
unchristian sneer, is elevated by a saintlike
zeal, to the expression of a devout whine: and
this I believe to be the only satisfactory explanation
which has ever been given, of the connection,
in so many good men, between the
<i>nasal</i> and the <i>religious!</i></p>

<br />
<p>But the schoolmaster usually possessed genuine
religious feeling, as well as a pious manner;
and, excepting an occasional display of hereditary,
and almost unconscious, cunning, he lived
&ldquo;a righteous and upright life.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>The process of becoming a respectable and
respected citizen was a very short and simple one&mdash;and
whether the schoolmaster designed to remain
only a lord of the ferrule, or casting the
insignia of his office behind him, to seek higher
things, he was never slow in adopting it.
Among his scholars, there were generally half-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>a-dozen
or more young women&mdash;marriageable
daughters of substantial men; and from this
number he selected, courted, and espoused, some
healthy, buxom girl, the heiress of a considerable
plantation or a quantity of &ldquo;wild land.&rdquo;
He always sought these two requisites combined&mdash;for
he was equally fond of a fine person and
handsome estate. Upon the land, he generally
managed to find an eligible town-site; and,
being a perfect master of the art of building
cities on paper, and puffing them into celebrity,
his sales of town-lots usually brought him a
competent fortune. As years rolled on, his substance
increased with the improvement of the
country&mdash;the rougher points of his character
were gradually rubbed down&mdash;age and gray
hairs thickened upon his brow&mdash;honors, troops
of friends, and numerous children, gathered
round him&mdash;and the close of his career found
him respected in life and lamented in death.
His memory is a monument of what honesty
and industry, even without worldly advantages,
may always accomplish.</p>

<div class="sidenoteb"><p>[NOTE.&mdash;A friend expresses a doubt whether I have not made
the foregoing portrait too hard-featured for historical accuracy;
and, by way of fortifying his opinion, points to illustrious examples
of men who have taught schools in their youth&mdash;senators
and statesmen&mdash;some of whom now hold prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>positions before the people, even for the highest offices in their
gift. But these men never belonged to the class which I have
attempted to portray. Arriving in this country in youth,
without the means of subsistence&mdash;in many cases, long before
they had acquired the professions which afterward made them
famous&mdash;they resorted to school-teaching as a mere expedient
for present support, without any intention to make it the occupation
of their lives, or the means of their advancement.
They were moved by an ambition which looked beyond it, and
they invariably abandoned it so soon as they had prepared
themselves for another pursuit.</p>

<p>But the genuine <i>character</i> took it up as a permanent employment&mdash;he
looked to it not only as a means of temporary
subsistence, but as a source, by some of the direct or indirect
channels which we have indicated, of lasting income&mdash;and he
never threw it up until he had already secured that to which
the other class, when <i>they</i> abandoned the occupation, were still
looking forward. In the warfare against Ignorance, therefore,
these, whom we have described, were the regular army, while
the exceptions were but volunteers for a limited period, and,
in the muster-roll of permanent strength, they are, therefore,
not included.]</p></div>

<span class="caption">THE SCHOOLMISTRESS.</span></div>

<p>But the family of the pioneer consisted of
girls as well as boys; and though the former
were never so carefully educated as the latter,
they were seldom allowed to go wholly untaught.</p>

<p>The more modern system, which separates
the sexes while infants, and never suffers them
to come together again until they are &ldquo;marriageable,&rdquo;
was not then introduced; and we
think it would have been no great misfortune
to the country had it remained in Spain, whence
it would seem to have been imported. Children
of both sexes were intended to grow up together&mdash;to
be educated in company&mdash;at least until
they have reached the points where their paths
naturally diverge, for thus only can they be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
most useful to each other, in the duties, trials, and
struggles, of after life. The artificial refinement
which teaches a little girl that a boy is something
to be dreaded&mdash;a sort of beast of prey&mdash;before
she recognises any difference, save in
dress, can never benefit her at best; for by-and-by
she will discover the falsehood: the very
instincts of her nature would unveil it, did she
learn it in no other way: and as action and reaction
are equal, the rebound may cause her to
entertain opinions altogether too favorable to
those whom she has so foolishly been taught to
fear.</p>

<p>Nor is the effect of such a system likely to
be any better upon the other sex: for it is association
with females (as early as possible, too,
all the better), which softens, humanizes, graces,
and adorns the masculine character. The boy
who has been denied such association&mdash;the incidents
to whose education have made him shy,
as so many are, even of little girls&mdash;is apt to
grow up morose and selfish, ill-tempered, and
worse mannered. When the impulses of his
developing nature finally force him into female
society, he goes unprepared, and comes away
without profit: his ease degenerates into familiarity,
his conversation is, at best, but washy
sentimentalism, and the association, until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
accumulated rust of youth is worn away, is of
very doubtful benefit to both parties. Indeed,
parents who thus govern and educate their
children, can find no justification for the practice,
until they can first so alter the course of
Nature, as to establish the law, that each family
shall be composed altogether of girls, or shall
consist exclusively of boys!</p>

<br />
<p>But these modern refinements had not obtained
currency, at the period of which we are
writing; nor was any such nonsense the motive
to the introduction of female teachers. But
one of the lessons learned by observation of the
domestic circle, and particularly of the influence
of the mother over her children, was the
principle, that a woman can teach males of a
certain age quite as well as a man, and <i>females
much better</i>; and that, since the school-teacher
stands, for the time in the place of the parent,
a <i>mistress</i> was far more desirable, especially for
the girls, than a <i>master</i>. Hence, the latter had
exercised his vocation in the west, but a few
years, before he was followed by the former.</p>

<br />
<p>New England was the great nursery of this
class, as it was of so many others, transplanted
beyond the Alleghenies. Emigration, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
enticements and casualties of a seafaring life&mdash;drawing
the men into their appropriate channels
of enterprise and adventure, had there reduced
their number below that of the women&mdash;thus
remitting many of the latter, to other than
the usual and natural occupations of &ldquo;the sex.&rdquo;
Matrimony became a remote possibility to large
numbers&mdash;attention to household matters gave
place to various kinds of light labor&mdash;and, since
they were not likely to have progeny of their
own to rear, many resorted to the teaching of
children belonging to others. Idleness was a
rare vice; and New England girls&mdash;to their
honor be it spoken&mdash;have seldom resembled
&ldquo;the lilies of the field,&rdquo; in aught, save the fairness
of their complexions! They have never
displayed much squeamishness&mdash;about work:
and if they could not benefit the rising generation
in a maternal, were willing to make themselves
useful in a tutorial capacity. The people
of that enlightened section, have always
possessed the learning necessary to appreciate,
and the philanthropy implied in the wish to
dispel, the benighted ignorance of all other
quarters of the world; and thus a competent
number of them have ever been found willing
to give up the comforts of home, for the benefit
of the &ldquo;barbarous west<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The schoolmistress, then, generally came from
the &ldquo;cradle&rdquo; of intelligence, as well as &ldquo;of liberty,&rdquo;
beyond the Hudson; and, in the true
spirit of benevolence, she carried her blessings
(herself the greatest) across the mountain barrier,
to bestow them, <i>gratis</i>, upon the spiritually
and materially needy, in the valley of the
Mississippi. Her vocation, or, as it would now
be called, her &ldquo;mission&rdquo; was to teach an impulse
not only given by her education, but belonging
to her nature. She had a constitutional
tendency toward it&mdash;indeed, a genius for it;
like that which impels one to painting, another
to sculpture&mdash;this to a learned profession, that
to a mechanical trade. And so perfectly was
she adapted to it, that &ldquo;the ignorant people
of the west&rdquo; not recognising her &ldquo;divine appointment,&rdquo;
were often at a loss to conjecture,
who, or whether anybody, could have taught
<i>her!</i></p>

<p>For that same &ldquo;ignorant,&rdquo; and too often, ungrateful
people, she was full of tender pity&mdash;the
yearning of the single-hearted missionary,
for the welfare of his flock. <i>They</i> were steeped
in darkness, but <i>she</i> carried the light&mdash;nay, she
<i>was</i> the light! and with a benignity, often
evinced by self-sacrifice&mdash;she poured it graciously
over the land&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Heaven doth with us, as we with torches do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did not go forth of us, 't were all alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if we had them not.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For the good of the race, or of any (male) individual,
she would immolate herself, even upon
the altar of Hymen; and, since the number,
who were to be benefited by such self-devotement,
was small in New England, but large in
the west, she did well to seek a field for her
benign dedication, beyond the Alleghenies!
Honor to the all-daring self-denial, which
brought to the forlorn bachelor of the west, a
companion in his labors, a solace in his afflictions,
and a mother to his children!</p>

<br />
<p>Her name was invariably Grace, Charity, or
Prudence; and, if names had been always descriptive
of the personal qualities of those who
bore them, she would have been entitled to all
three.</p>

<br />
<p>In the early ages of the world, names were,
or, at least, were supposed to be, fair exponents
of the personal characters of those, upon whom
they were bestowed. But, <i>then</i>, the qualities
must be manifested, before the name could be
earned, so that all who had never distinguished
themselves, in some way, were said to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
&ldquo;nameless.&rdquo; In more modern times, however,
an improvement upon this system was introduced:
the character was anticipated, and parents
called their children what they <i>wished</i>
them to be, in the hope that they would grow
to the standard thus imposed. And it is no
doubt, true, that names thus bestowed had
much influence in the development of character&mdash;on
the same principle, upon which the
boards, to which Indian women lash their infants
soon after birth, have much to do with the erect
carriage of the mature savage. Such an appellation
is a perpetual memento of parental counsels&mdash;a
substitute for barren precept&mdash;an endless
exhortation to Grace, Charity, or Prudence.</p>

<p>I do not mean, that calling a boy Cicero will
certainly make him an orator, or that all Jeremiahs
are necessarily prophets; nor is it improbable,
that the same peculiarities in the
parents, which dictate these expressive names,
may direct the characters of the children, by
controlling their education; but it is unquestionable,
that the characteristics, and even the
fortunes of the man, are frequently daguerreotyped
by a name given in infancy. There is
not a little wisdom in the advice of Sterne to
godfathers&mdash;not &ldquo;to Nicodemus a man into
nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Harsh names,&rdquo; says D'Israeli, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
elder, &ldquo;will have, in spite of all our philosophy,
a painful and ludicrous effect on our ears and
our associations; it is vexatious, that the softness
of delicious vowels, or the ruggedness of
inexorable consonants, should at all be connected
with a man's happiness, or even have an influence
on his fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>but this does not touch the question, whether,
if it had not smelt as sweet we would not have
given it some other name. The celebrated
demagogue, Wilkes, is reported to have said,
that, &ldquo;without knowing the comparative merits
of the two poets, we would have no hesitation
in preferring John Dryden to Elkanah Settle,
<i>from the names only</i>.&rdquo; And the reason of
this truth is to be found in the fact, that our
impressions of both men and things depend upon
associations, often beyond our penetration to detect&mdash;associations
with which <i>sound</i>, depending
on hidden laws, has quite as much to do, as <i>sense.</i></p>


<p>Among those who have carried the custom
of picturesque or expressive naming, to an extent
bordering on the ridiculous, were the hard-headed
champions of the true church-militant,
the English puritans&mdash;as Hume, the bigoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
old Tory, rather ill-naturedly testifies! And the
puritans of <i>New</i> England&mdash;whatever advancing
intelligence may have made them in the
present&mdash;were, for a long time, faithful representatives
of the oddities, as well as of the virtues,
of their fathers.</p>

<p>And, accordingly, we find the schoolmistress&mdash;being
a descendant of the Jason's-crew, who
landed from the Argo-Mayflower, usually bearing
a name thus significant, and manifesting,
even at her age, traits of character justifying
the compellation. What that age precisely <i>was</i>,
could not always be known; indeed, a lady's
age is generally among indeterminate things;
and it has, very properly, come to be considered
ungallant, if not impertinent, to be curious
upon so delicate a subject. A man has no more
right to know how many years a woman has,
than how many skirts she wears; and, if he have
any anxiety about the matter, in either case,
his eyes must be the only questioners. The
principle upon which the women themselves
proceed, in growing old, seems to be parallel
to the law of gravitation: when a **storm** stone, for
example, is thrown into the air the higher it
goes the slower it travels; and the momentum
toward Heaven, given to a woman at her birth,
appears to decrease in about the same ratio.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>We will not be so ungallant, then, as to inquire
too curiously into the age of the schoolmistress;
but, without disparagement to her
youthfulness, we may be allowed to conjecture
that, in order to fit her so well for the duties
of her responsible station (and incline her to
undertake such labors), a goodly number of
years must needs have been required. Yet she
bore time well; for, unless married in the meanwhile,
at thirty, she was as youthful in manners,
as at eighteen.</p>

<p>But this is not surprising: for, even as early
as her twelfth year, she had much the appearance
of a mature woman&mdash;something like that
noticed in young quakers, by Clarkson<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>&mdash;and
her figure belonged to that rugged type, which
is adapted to bear, unscathed, more than the
ravages of time. She was never above the medium
height, for the rigid rule of economy
seemed to apply to flesh and blood, as to all
other things pertaining to her race; at all events,
material had not been wasted in giving her extra
longitude&mdash;at the ends. Between the extremities,
it might be different&mdash;for she was
generally very long-waisted. But this might
be accounted for in the process of <i>flattening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>out</i>: for like her compeer, the schoolmaster,
she had much more breadth than thickness.
She was somewhat angular, of course, and rather
bony; but this was only the natural correspondence,
between the external development,
and the mental and moral organization. Her
eyes were usually blue, and, to speak with accuracy,
a little cold and grayish, in their expression&mdash;like
the sky on a bleak morning in Autumn.
Her forehead was very high and prominent,
having, indeed, an <i>exposed</i> look, like a
shelterless knoll in an open prairie: but, not
content with this, though the hair above it was
often thin, she usually dragged the latter forcibly
back, as if to increase the altitude of the
former, by extending the skin. Her mouth
was of that class called &ldquo;primped,&rdquo; but was
filled with teeth of respectable dimensions.</p>

<p>Her arms were long, and, indeed, a little
skinny, and she swung them very freely when
she walked; while hands, of no insignificant
size, dangled at the extremities, as if the joints
of her wrists were insecure. She had large
feet, too, and in walking her toes were assiduously
turned out. She had, however, almost
always one very great attraction&mdash;a fine, clear,
healthy complexion&mdash;and the only blemishes
upon this, that I have ever observed, were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
little <i>red</i> on the tip of her nose and on the points
of her cheek-bones, and a good deal of <i>down</i> on
her upper lip.</p>

<br />
<p>In manners and bearing, she was brisk, prim,
and sometimes a little &ldquo;fidgety,&rdquo; as if she was
conscious of sitting on a dusty chair; and she
had a way of searching nervously for her pocket,
as if to find a handkerchief with which to brush
it off. She was a very fast walker, and an
equally rapid talker&mdash;taking usually very short
steps, as if afraid of splitting economical skirts,
but using very long words, as if entertaining no
such apprehension about her throat. Her gait
was too rapid to be graceful, and her voice too
sharp to be musical; but she was quite unconscious
of these imperfections, especially of
the latter: for at church&mdash;I beg pardon of her
enlightened ancestors! I should say at &ldquo;<i>meeting</i>&rdquo;&mdash;her
notes of praise were heard high over
all the tumult of primitive singing; and, with
her chin thrown out, and her shoulders drawn
back, she looked, as well as sounded, the impersonation
of <i>melody</i>, as contra-distinguished from
<i>harmony!</i></p>

<br />
<p>But postponing, for the present, our consideration
of her qualifications as a teacher, we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
that her characteristics were still more respectable
and valuable as a private member of society.
And in this relation, her most prominent trait,
like that of her brother teacher, was her stainless
piety. In this respect, if in no other,
women are always more sincere and single-hearted
than men&mdash;perhaps because the distribution
of social duties gives her less temptation
to hypocrisy&mdash;and even the worldly,
strong-minded, and self-reliant daughter of the
church-hating Puritan-Zion, displayed a tendency
toward genuine religious feeling.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>But in our subject, this was not a mere bias,
but a constant, unflagging sentiment, an everyday
manifestation. She was as warm in the
cause of religion on one day as upon another,
in small things as in great&mdash;as zealous in the
repression of all unbecoming and ungodly levity,
as in the eradication of positive vice. Life was
too solemn a thing with her to admit of thoughtless
amusements&mdash;it was entirely a state of
probation, not to be enjoyed in itself, or for
itself, but purgatorial, remedial, and prepara<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>tory.
She hated all devices of pleasure as her
ancestors did the abominations of popery. A
fiddle she could tolerate only in the shape of a
bass-viol; and dancing, if practised at all, must
be called &ldquo;calisthenics.&rdquo; The drama was to
her an invention of the Enemy of Souls&mdash;and
if she ever saw a play, it must be at a <i>museum</i>,
and not within the walls of that temple of Baal,
the theatre. None but &ldquo;serious&rdquo; conversation
was allowable, and a hearty laugh was the expression
of a spirit ripe for the destination of
unforgiven sinners.</p>

<p>Errors in religion were too tremendous to be
tolerated for a moment, and the form (or rather
anti-form) of worship handed down by her
fathers, had cost too much blood and crime to
be oppugned. She thought Barebones's the
only godly parliament that ever sat, and did not
hate Hume half so much for his infidelity, as
for his ridicule of the roundheads. Her list of
martyrs was made up of the intruders ousted
by Charles's &ldquo;Act of Conformity,&rdquo; and her
catalogue of saints was headed by the witch-boilers
of Massachusetts Bay. She abhorred the
memory of all <i>popish</i> persecutions, and knew
no difference between catholic and cannibal.
Her running calendar of living saints were born
&ldquo;to inherit the earth,&rdquo; and heaven, too: they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
possessed a monopoly of all truth, an unlimited
&ldquo;indulgence&rdquo; to enforce conformity, and, in
their zeal, an infallible safeguard against the
commission of error. She had no patience with
those who could not &ldquo;see the truth;&rdquo; and he
who reviled the puritan mode of worship, was
&ldquo;worse than the infidel.&rdquo; The only argument
she ever used with such, was the <i>argumentum
ad hominem</i>, which saves the trouble of conviction
by &ldquo;giving over to hardness of heart.&rdquo;
New England was, to her, the land of Goshen&mdash;whither
God's people had been led by God's
hand&mdash;&ldquo;the land of the patriarchs, where it
rains righteousness&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>&mdash;and all the adjacent
country was a land of Egyptian darkness.</p>

<br />
<p>She was commendably prudent in her personal
deportment: being thoroughly pure and circumspect
herself, she could forgive no thoughtless
imprudence in her sister-woman: but she
well-understood metaphysical distinctions, and
was tolerant, if not liberal, to marriageable men.
These she could hope to reform at some future
time: and she had, moreover, a just idea of the
weakness of man's nature. But being a woman,
and a staid and sober-minded woman, she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
never understand the power of temptation upon
her own sex, or the commonest impulses of high
spirits. Perhaps she was a little deficient in
charity: but, as we have seen, it was chiefly
toward her female friends, and since none can
bear severe judgment more safely than woman,
her austerity did little harm.</p>

<p>But she sincerely regretted what she could
never palliate; she hated not the guilty, though
she could not forgive the sin; and no one was
more easily melted to tears by the faults, and
particularly by the <i>follies</i>, of the world. Wickedness
is a very melancholy thing, but it is to
be punished as well as lamented: and like the
unfortunate governor who was forced to condemn
his own son, she wept while she pronounced
judgment. But earthly sorrow, by
her, was given only to earthly faults: violations
of simple good morals, crimes against heavenly
creeds and forms (or rather <i>the</i> form) of worship,
claimed no tear. Her blood rose to fever-heat
at the mention of an unbeliever, and she would
as soon have wept for the errors of the fallen
angels, as for those of anti-Robinsonians.</p>

<br />
<p>But though thus rigid and austere, I never
heard that she was at all disinclined to being
courted: especially if it gave her any prospect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of being able to make herself useful as a wife,
either to herself, her husband, or her country.
She understood the art of rearing and managing
children, in her capacity as a teacher: she
was thus peculiarly well-fitted for matrimonial
duties, and was unwilling that the world should
lose the benefit of her talents. But the man
who courted her must do so in the most sober,
staid, and regulated spirit, for it was seldom any
unmixed romance about &ldquo;love and nonsense,&rdquo;
which moved <i>her</i> to the sacrifice: if she entertained
notions of that sort, they were such only
as could find a place in her well-balanced mind,
and, above all, were the subject of no raptures
or transports of delight. If she indulged any
enthusiasm, in view of the approaching change,
it was in the prospect of endless shirt-making,
and in calculations about how cheaply (not how
happily) she could enable her husband to live.
She had no squeamish delicacy about allowing
the world to know the scope and meaning of
her arrangements, and all her friends participated
in her visions of comfort and economy.
False modesty was no part of her nature&mdash;and
her sentiment could be reduced to an algebraic
formula&mdash;excluding the &ldquo;unknown quantities&rdquo;
usually represented by the letters <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>:
meaning &ldquo;bliss,&rdquo; &ldquo;cottages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;devotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, though she cared little for poetry, and
seldom understood the images of fancy, she was
not averse to a modicum of scandal in moments
of relaxation: for the faults of others were the
illustrations of her prudent maxims, and the
thoughtlessness of a sister was the best possible
text for a moral homily. The tense rigidity of
her character, too, sometimes required a little
unbending, and she had, therefore, no special
aversion to an occasional surreptitious novel.
But this she would indulge only in private; for
in her mind, the worst quality of transgression
was its bad example; and she never failed, in
public, to condemn all such things with becoming
and virtuous severity. Nor must this
apparent inconsistency be construed to her disadvantage;
for her strong mind and well-fortified
morals, could withstand safely what would
have corrupted a large majority of those around
her; and it was meet, that one whose &ldquo;mission&rdquo;
it was to reform, should thoroughly understand
the enemy against which she battled. And
these things never unfavorably affected her life
and manners, for she was as prudent in her deportment
(ill-natured people say <i>prudish</i>) as if
some ancestress of hers had been deceived, and
left in the family a tradition of man's perfidy
and woman's frailty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>She was careful, then, of three things&mdash;her
clothes, her money, and her reputation: and, to
do her justice, the last was as spotless as the
first, and as much prized as the second, and that
is saying a good deal, both for its purity and
estimation. Neat, economical, and prudent,
were, indeed, the three capital adjectives of her
vocabulary, and to deserve them was her
eleventh commandment.</p>

<p>With one exception, these were the texts of
all her homilies, and the exception was, unluckily,
one which admitted of much more
argument.</p>

<p>It was the history of the puritans. But upon
this subject, she was as dexterous a special
pleader as Neale, and as skilful in giving a
false coloring to facts, as D'Aubign&eacute;. But she
had the advantage of these worthies in that her
declamation was quite honest: she had been
taught sincerely and heartily to believe all she
asserted. She was of the opinion that but two
respectable ships had been set afloat since the
world began: one of which was Noah's ark,
and the other the Mayflower. She believed
that no people had ever endured such persecutions
as the puritans, and was especially eloquent
upon the subject of &ldquo;New England's Blarney-stone,&rdquo;
the Rock of Plymouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, according to the creed of her people,
historical and religious, this is the only piece of
granite in the whole world &ldquo;worth speaking of;&rdquo;
and geologists have sadly wasted their time in
travelling over the world in search of the records
of creation, when a full epitome of everything
deserving to be known, existed in so small a
space! All the other rocks of the earth sink
into insignificance, and &ldquo;hide their diminished
heads,&rdquo; when compared to this mighty stone!
The Rock of Leucas, from which the amorous
Lesbian maid cast herself disconsolate into the
sea, is a mere pile of dirt: the Tarpeian, whence
the Law went forth to the whole world for so
many centuries, is not fit to be mentioned in the
same day: the Rock of Cashel, itself, is but the
subject of profane Milesian oaths; and the
Ledge of Plymouth is the real &ldquo;Rock of Ages!&rdquo;
It is well that every people should have something
to adore, especially if that &ldquo;something&rdquo;
belongs exclusively to themselves. It elevates
their self-respect: and, for this object, even historical
fictions may be forgiven.</p>

<br />
<p>But, as we have intimated, in the course of
time the schoolmistress became a married
woman; and as she gathered experience, she
gradually learned that New England is not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
whole &ldquo;moral vineyard,&rdquo; and that one might
be more profitably employed than in disputing
about questionable points of history. New
duties devolved upon her, and new responsibilities
rained fast. Instead of teaching the
children of other people, she now raised children
for other people to teach. New sources of
pride were found in these, and in her husband
and his prosperity. She discovered that she
could be religious without bigotry, modest
without prudery, and economical without meanness:
and, profiting by the lessons thus learned,
she subsided into a true, faithful, and respectable
matron, thus, at last, fulfilling her genuine
&ldquo;mission.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE POLITICIAN.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;All would be deemed, e'en from the cradle, fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule in politics as well as wit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave, the gay, the fopling, and the dunce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Start up (God bless us!) statesmen all at once!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><span class="smcap">Churchill</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a country where the popular breath sways
men to its purposes or caprices, as the wind
bends the weeds in a meadow, statesmanship
may become a <i>system</i>, but can never rise to the
dignity of a <i>science</i>; and politics, instead of
being an <i>art</i>, is a series of <i>arts.</i></p>

<p>A system is order without principle: a science
is order, based upon principle. Statesmanship
has to do with generalities&mdash;with the relations
of states, the exposition and preservation of constitutional
provisions, and with fundamental
organizations. Politics relates to measures, and
the details of legislation. The <i>art</i> of governing
is the accomplishment of the true politician:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
the <i>arts</i> of governing are the trickeries of the
demagogue. <i>Right</i> is the key-note of one:
<i>popularity</i> of the other.</p>

<br />
<p>The large majority of men are sufficiently
candid to acknowledge&mdash;at least to themselves&mdash;that
they are unfit for the station of law-giver;
but the vanity and jealousy begotten by participation
in political power, lead many of them,
if not actually to believe, at all events to <i>act</i>
upon the faith, that men, no more able than
themselves, are the best material for rulers. It
is a kind of compromise between their modesty
and self-love: not burthening them with the
trials and responsibilities of positions for which
they feel incompetent, but soothing their vanity
by the contemplation of office-holders not at all
their superiors. Below a certain (or uncertain)
grade, therefore, political stations are usually
filled by men of very moderate abilities: and
their elevation is favored&mdash;indeed, often effected&mdash;by
the very causes which should prevent
it. Such men are prone to thrust themselves
upon public notice, and thus secure, by persistence
and impudence, what might not be awarded
them on the score of merit.</p>

<p>It is a trite remark, that people are inclined
to accept a man's estimate of himself, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
put him in possession of that place, in their consideration,
which he has the hardihood to claim.
And the observation is just, to this extent: if
the individual does not respect himself, probably
no one else will take that trouble. But in a
country where universal suffrage reigns, it may
be doubted whether the elevation of an ordinary
man indicates any recognition of the justice of
his claims. On the contrary, they may be endorsed
precisely because they are false: that is,
because he really possesses no other title to the
support of common men, than that which is
founded upon fellow-feeling or sympathy of
character. Many a man, therefore, who receives
his election as a compliment from the
voters, if he understood the motives of their
action, would throw up his office in disgust; for
in a large majority of cases, the popular choice,
so far from being an assertion of the candidate's
peculiar fitness to be singled out from among
his brethren, is only a declaration that neither
talent nor character entitles him to the distinction.
The cry that a man is &ldquo;one of the
people,&rdquo; will bring him great strength at the
ballot-box: but this is a phrase which means
very different things, according as it is used by
the candidate or the voter; and, in many cases,
if they could thoroughly understand each other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the latter would not give his support, and the
former would not ask it.</p>

<br />
<p>These remarks are applicable to all stages of
society's progress; for, if the world were so enlightened,
that, in the scale of intellect, such a
man as Daniel Webster could only be classed
as an idiot, there would still be the &ldquo;ignorant
vulgar,&rdquo; the &ldquo;uneducated classes.&rdquo; Society
is one entire web&mdash;albeit woven with threads
of wool and silk, of silver and gold: turn it as
you will, it must all turn together; and if a
whirlwind of enlightenment should waft it to
the skies, although each thread would be immeasurably
above its present condition, the
relation of one to another would still be the
same. If the baser wool should be transmuted
into gold, the very same process would refine
and sublimate the precious metal, in a corresponding
ratio; and the equilibrium of God's
appointed relations would remain undisturbed.</p>

<br />
<p>But it is more especially in the primitive
periods, before the great political truths become
household words, and while the reign of
law and municipal organization is a vague and
distant thing, that most citizens shrink from
official duties. Diffidence, in this matter is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
fortunately, a disease which time will alleviate&mdash;a
youthful weakness, which communities
&ldquo;outgrow,&rdquo; as children do physical defects;
and, I believe, of late years, few offices have
&ldquo;gone begging,&rdquo; either east or west of the great
barrier of the Allegheny.</p>

<p>In the earlier periods of its history, we have
seen that the western country was peculiarly
situated. The settlements were weak and the
population small; with the exception of a few
narrow fields, in the vicinity of each frontier
fort, or stockade, the land was a wilderness, held
in undisturbed possession by the savages and
wild beasts. The great struggle, which we call
the Revolution, but which was, in fact, only a
justifiable and successful rebellion, had exhausted
the force and drained the coffers of the
feeble federal government; had plunged the
infant states into enormous debts; and the only
means of paying these were the boundless but
unclaimed lands of the west, which the same
causes rendered them unable to protect. The
scattered settlements on the Mississippi side of
the Alleghenies, were thus left to their own
scanty resources; and the distance was so
great, that, had the older states been able to
afford assistance, the delays and losses attendant
upon its transmission across so wide a tract of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
wilderness, would have made it almost nugatory.</p>

<p>In those times, therefore, though a few were
looking forward to separate political organization
and the erection of new states, the larger
number of the western people were too constantly
occupied with their defence, to give
much attention to internal politics. Such organization
as they had was military, or patriarchal:
the early pioneer, who had distinguished
himself in the first explorations of
the country, or by successfully leading and
establishing a new settlement, as he became the
commander of the local fort, was also the law-giver
of the community. The pressure of external
danger was too close to allow a very
liberal democracy in government; and, as must
be the case in all primitive assemblages of men,
the counsels and commands of him whom they
knew to be the <i>most able</i>, were always observed.
He who had proven himself competent to lead
was, therefore, the leader <i>ipso facto</i> and <i>de
jure</i>; and the evidence required was the performance
of such exploits, and the display of
such courage and sagacity, as were necessary
to the defence, well-being, and protection of
the community.</p>

<p>It is obvious that no mere pretender could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
exhibit these proofs; and that, where they were
taken as the sole measure of a man's worth,
dexterity with a rifle must be of more value
than the accomplishments of a talker&mdash;Indian-fighting
a more respectable occupation than
speech-making. Small politicians were, therefore,
very small men, and saying that one had
&ldquo;a turn for politics,&rdquo; would have been equivalent
to calling him a vagabond. The people
had neither time nor patience to listen to declamation&mdash;the
man who rose in a public assembly,
and called upon his neighbors to follow him in
avenging a wrong, made the only speech they
cared to hear. &ldquo;Preambles and resolutions&rdquo;
were unmeaning formalities&mdash;their &ldquo;resolutions&rdquo;
were taken in their own minds, and, to
use their own expressive words, they executed
them &ldquo;without preamble.&rdquo; An ounce of lead
was worth more than a pound of advice; and,
in the vindication of justice, a &ldquo;charge&rdquo; of gunpowder
was more effectual than the most tedious
judicial harangue. It is, even now, a proud,
but well-founded boast, of western men, that
these traits have been transmitted to them from
their fathers&mdash;that they are more remarkable
for <i>fighting</i> than for <i>wrangling</i>, for <i>acting</i> than
for <i>talking.</i></p>

<p>In such a state of society, civil offices existed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
scarcely in name, and were never very eagerly
sought. That which makes official station desirable
is obedience to its authority, and if the
title of &ldquo;captain&rdquo; gave the idea of more absolute
power than that of &ldquo;sheriff,&rdquo; one would
rather command a company of militia than the
&ldquo;<i>posse comitatus</i>.&rdquo; Besides, the men of the
frontier were simple-hearted and unambitious,
desiring nothing so much as to be &ldquo;left alone,&rdquo;
and willing to make a compact of forbearance
with the whole world&mdash;excepting only the Indians.
They had never been accustomed to the
restraints of municipal regulations, they were
innocent of the unhealthy pleasures of office-holding,
or the degrading impulses of office-seeking.
Their lives had given them little or no
knowledge of these things; experience had never
suggested their importance, for their acquaintance
with life was, almost exclusively, such as
could be acquired in the woods and forest
pathways.</p>

<p>But as time rolled away, and the population
of the country became more dense&mdash;as the
pressure of external danger was withdrawn, and
the necessities of defence grew less urgent&mdash;the
rigor of military organization came gradually
to be somewhat irksome. The seeds of
civil institutions began to germinate among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
people, while the extending interests of communities
required corresponding enactments and
regulations. The instincts of social beings, love
of home and family, attachment to property, the
desire of tranquillity, and, perhaps, a leaven of
ambition for good estimation among neighbors,
all combined to open men's eyes to the importance
of peaceful institutions. The day of the
rifle and scalping-knife passed away, and justice
without form&mdash;the rule of the elementary
strong-hand&mdash;gave place to order and legal
ceremony.</p>

<br />
<p>Then first began to appear the class of politicians,
though, as yet, office-seeking had not
become a trade, nor office-holding a regular
means of livelihood. Politics had not acquired
a place among the arts, nor had its professors
become the teachers of the land. There were
few, indeed, who sought to fill civil stations;
and, although men's qualifications for office
were, probably, not any more rigidly examined
then than now, those who possessed the due
degree of prominence, either deemed themselves,
or were believed by their fellow-citizens,
peculiarly capable of discharging such functions.
They were generally men who had made themselves
conspicuous or useful in other capacities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>&mdash;who
had become well or favorably known to
their neighbors through their zeal, courage,
sagacity, or public spirit. A leader of regulators,
for example, whose administration of his
dangerous powers had been marked by promptitude
and severity, was expected to be equally
efficient when clothed with more regular authority.
A captain of rangers, whose enterprises
had been remarkable for certainty and
<i>finish</i>, would, it was believed, do quite as good
service, in the capacity of a civil officer. A
daring pioneer, whose courage or presence of
mind had saved himself and others from the
dangers of the wilderness, was supposed to be
an equally sure guide in the pathless ways of
politics. Lawyers were yet few, and not of
much repute, for they were, for the most part,
youthful adventurers, who had come into the
field long before the ripening of the harvest.</p>

<br />
<p>There was another class, whose members held
prominent positions, though they had never
been distinguished for the possession of any of
the qualifications above enumerated. These
might be designated as the <i>noisy</i> sort&mdash;loud-talking,
wise-looking men, self-constituted oracles
and advice-givers, with a better opinion of
their own wisdom than any one else was willing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
to endorse. Such men became &ldquo;file-leaders,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;pivot-men,&rdquo; because the taciturn people of
the west, though inclined to undervalue a mere
talker, were simple-minded enough to accept a
man's valuation of his own powers: or easy-tempered
enough to spare themselves the trouble
of investigating so small a matter. It was of
little consequence to them, whether the candidate
was as wise as he desired to be thought;
and since, in political affairs, they knew of no
interest which they could have in disputing it,
for <i>his</i> gratification they were willing to admit
it. These were halcyon days for mere pretenders&mdash;though
for no very flattering reason:
since their claims were allowed chiefly because
they were not deemed worth controverting.
Those days, thanks to the &ldquo;progress of intelligence!&rdquo;
are now gone by: the people are better
acquainted with the natural history of such
animals, and&mdash;witness, ye halls of Congress!&mdash;none
may now hold office except capable, patriotic,
and disinterested men!</p>

<p>Nor must we be understood to assert that the
primitive politician was the reverse of all this,
save in the matter of capability. And, even in
that particular, no conception of his deficiency
ever glimmered in his consciousness. His own
assumption, and the complaisance of his fellow-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>citizens,
were inter-reactive, mutually cause
and effect. <i>They</i> were willing to confirm his
valuation of his own talents: <i>he</i> was inclined to
exalt himself in their good opinion. Parallel
to this, also, was the oracular tone of his speech:
the louder he talked, the more respectfully silent
were his auditors; and the more attentive <i>they</i>
became, the noisier <i>he</i> grew. Submission always
encourages oppression, and admiration adds
fuel to the fire of vanity. Not that the politician
was precisely a despot, even over men's
opinions: the application of that name to him
would have been as sore a wound to his self-respect
as the imputation of horse-stealing. He
was but an oracle of opinion, and though allowed
to dictate in matters of thought as absolutely as
if backed by brigades of soldiers, he was a
sovereign whose power existed only through
the consent of his subjects.</p>

<br />
<p>In personal appearance, he was well-calculated
to retain the authority intrusted to him by
such men. He was, in fact, an epitome of all
the physical qualities which distinguished the
rugged people of the west: and between these
and the moral and intellectual, there is an invariable
correspondence&mdash;as if the spirit within
had moulded its material encasement to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
planes and angles of its own &ldquo;form and pressure.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<p>National form and feature are the external
marks of national character, stamped more or
less distinctly in different individuals, but, in
the aggregate, perfectly correspondent and commensurate.
The man, therefore, who possesses
the national traits of character in their best development,
will be, also, the most faithful representative
of his race in physical characteristics.
At some periods, there are whole classes of these
types; and if there be any <i>one</i> who embodies
the character more perfectly than all others, the
tranquillity of the age is not calculated to draw
him forth. But in all times of trouble&mdash;of
revolution or national ferment&mdash;the perfect
Man-emblem is seen to rise, and (which is more
to the purpose) is sure to stand at the head of
his fellows: for he who best represents the character
of his followers, becomes, by God's appointment,
their leader. To this extent, the
<i>vox populi</i> is the <i>vox Dei</i>; and the unfailing
success of every such man, throughout his appointed
term, is the best possible justification
of the choice.</p>

<p>What was Washington, for example, but an
epitome of the steady and noble qualities com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>bined
of cavalier and puritan, which were then
coalescing in the American character? And
what more perfect correspondence could be
conceived between the moral and intellectual
and the physical outlines? What was Cromwell
but <i>the Englishman</i>, not only of his own
time, but of all times? And the testimony of
all who saw him, what is it, but that a child,
who looked upon him, could not fail to see, in
his very lineaments, the great and terrible man
he was? And Napoleon, was he aught but an
abridgment of the French nation, the sublimate
and &ldquo;proof&rdquo; essence of French character?
Not one, of all the great men of history,
has possessed, so far as we know, a physical
constitution more perfectly representing, even
in its advancing grossness, both the strength
and weakness of the people he led.</p>

<p>In tranquil times, these things are not observed
in one individual more than in others of
his class, and we are, therefore, not prepared to
decide whether, at such periods, <i>the one man</i>
exists. The great Leviathan, the king of all the
creatures of the ocean, rises to the surface only
in the tumult of the storm; his huge, portentous
form, lies on the face of the troubled waters only
when the currents are changed and the fountains
of the deep are broken up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Nature does no superfluous work, and it may
require the same causes which produce the
storm to organize its Ruler. If a great rebellion
is boiling among men, the mingling of the elements
is projecting, also, the Great Rebel: if a
national cause is to be asserted, the principles
upon which it rests will first create its appropriate
Exponent. But when no such agitation
is on the point of breaking out&mdash;when the
crisis is not near, and the necessity for such
greatness distant&mdash;national character probably
retains its level; and though there be no <i>one</i>
whom the people will recognise as the arch-man,
the representatives, losing in intensity what they
gain in numbers, become a class. They fill the
civil stations of the country, and are known as
men of mark&mdash;their opinions are received,
their advice accepted, their leading followed.
No one of them is known instinctively, or
trusted implicitly, as the leader of Nature's appointment:
yet they are, in fact, the exponents
of their time and race, and in exact proportion
to the degree in which they possess the character,
will they exhibit, also, the physical peculiarities.</p>

<br />
<p>Thus it was at the time of which we are
writing, with the class to which belonged the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
politician, and a description of his personal appearance,
like that of any other man, will convey
no indistinct impression of his internal
character.</p>

<p>Such a description probably combined more
characteristic adjectives than that of any other
personage of his time&mdash;adjectives, some of
which were applicable to many of his neighbors,
respectively, but <i>all</i> of which might be
bestowed upon him <i>only</i>. He was tall, gaunt,
angular, swarthy, active, and athletic. His hair
was, invariably, black as the wing of the raven;
even in that small portion which the cap of
raccoon-skin left exposed to the action of sun
and rain, the gray was but thinly scattered;
imparting to the monotonous darkness only a
more iron character. As late as the present
day, though we have changed in many things,
light-haired men seldom attain eminence among
the western people: many of our legislators are
<i>young</i> enough, but none of them are <i>beardless</i>.
They have a bilious look, as if, in case of illness,
their only hope would lie in calomel and jalap.
One might understand, at the first glance, that
they are men of <i>talent</i>, not of <i>genius</i>; and that
physical energy, the enduring vitality of the
body, has no inconsiderable share in the power
of the mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>Corresponding to the sable of the hair, the
politician's eye was usually small, and intensely
black&mdash;not the dead, inexpressive jet,
which gives the idea of a hole through white
paper, or of a cavernous socket in a death's-head;
but the keen, midnight darkness, in whose
depths you can see a twinkle of starlight&mdash;where
you feel that there is meaning as well as
color. There might be an expression of cunning
along with that of penetration&mdash;but, in a much
higher degree, the blaze of irascibility. There
could be no doubt, from its glance, that its possessor
was an excellent hater; you might be
assured that he would never forget an injury or
betray a friend.</p>

<p>A stoop in the shoulders indicated that, in
times past, he had been in the habit of carrying
a heavy rifle, and of closely examining the
ground over which he walked; but what the
chest thus lost in depth it gained in breadth.
His lungs had ample space in which to play&mdash;there
was nothing pulmonary even in the drooping
shoulders. Few of his class have ever lived
to a very advanced age, but it was not for want
of iron-constitutions, that they went early to
the grave. The same services to his country,
which gave the politician his prominence, also
shortened his life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>From shoulders thus bowed, hung long, muscular
arms&mdash;sometimes, perhaps, dangling a
little ungracefully, but always under the command
of their owner, and ready for any effort,
however violent. These were terminated by
broad, bony hands, which looked like grapnels&mdash;their
grasp, indeed, bore no faint resemblance
to the hold of those symmetrical instruments.
Large feet, whose toes were usually turned in,
like those of the Indian, were wielded by limbs
whose vigor and activity were in keeping with
the figure they supported. Imagine, with these
peculiarities, a free, bold, rather swaggering gait,
a swarthy complexion, and conformable features
and tones of voice: and&mdash;excepting his costume&mdash;you
have before your fancy a complete
picture of the early western politician.</p>

<p>But the item of costume is too important to
be passed over with a mere allusion. As well
might we paint a mountain without its verdant
clothing, its waving plumes of pine and cedar,
as the western man without his picturesque and
characteristic habiliments. The first, and indispensable
article of dress, was the national
hunting-shirt: a garment whose easy fit was
well-adapted, both to the character of his figure
and the freedom of his movements. Its nature
did not admit much change in fashion: the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
variations of which it was capable, were those
of ornament and color. It might be fringed
around the cape and skirt, or made plain; it
might be blue, or copper-colored&mdash;perhaps
tinged with a little madder. And the variety
of material was quite as limited, since it must
be of either jeans or deer-skin.</p>

<p>Corresponding to this, in material, style, and
texture, he wore, also, a pair of wide pantaloons&mdash;not
always of precisely the proper length for
the limbs of the wearer, but having invariably
a broad waistband, coming up close under the
arms, and answering the purpose of the modern
vest. People were not so dainty about &ldquo;set&rdquo;
and &ldquo;fit,&rdquo; in those days, as they have since become;
and these primitive integuments were
equally well-adapted to the figure of any one to
whose lot they might fall. In their production,
no one had been concerned save the family of
the wearer. The sheep which bore the wool,
belonged to his own flock, and all the operations,
subsequent to the shearing, necessary to
the ultimate result of shaping into a garment,
had been performed by his wife or daughter.
Many politicians have continued this affectation
of plainness, even when the necessity has ceased,
on account of its effect upon the masses; for
people are apt to entertain the notion, that de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>cent
clothing is incompatible with mental
ability, and that he who is most manifestly behind
the improvements of the time, is best
qualified for official stations.</p>

<p>A neck-cloth, or cravat, was never seen about
the politician's throat; and for the same reason
of expediency: for these were refinements of
affectation which had not then been introduced;
and a man who thus compassed his neck, could
no more have been elected to an office, than if
he had worn the cap and bells of a Saxon jester.
The shirt-bosoms of modern days were in the
same category; and <i>starch</i> was an article contraband
to the law of public sentiment&mdash;insomuch
that no epithet expressed more thorough
contempt for a man, than the graphic word
&ldquo;starched.&rdquo; A raccoon-skin cap&mdash;or, as a piece
of extravagant finery, a white-wool hat&mdash;with
a pair of heavy shoes, not unfrequently without
the luxury of hose&mdash;or, if with them, made of
blue-woollen yarn, from the back of a sheep
of the aforesaid flock&mdash;completed the element
of costume.</p>

<p>He was not very extravagantly dressed, as
the reader sees; but we can say of him&mdash;what
could not be as truly spoken of many men, or,
indeed, of many women, of this day&mdash;that his
clothing bore distinct reference to his character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and was well-adapted to his &ldquo;style of beauty.&rdquo;
In fact, everything about him, form, face, manners,
dress, was in &ldquo;in keeping&rdquo; with his characteristics.</p>

<br />
<p>In occupation, he was usually a farmer; for
the materials of which popular tribunes are
made in later times&mdash;such as lawyers, gentlemen
of leisure, and pugnacious preachers&mdash;were
not then to be found. The population of
the country was thoroughly agricultural; and
though (as I believe I have elsewhere observed)
the rural people of the west were neither a
cheerful nor a polished race, as a class, they
possess, even yet, qualities, which, culminating
in an individual, eminently fit him for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
of a noisy popular leader.</p>

<p>But a man who is merely fitted to such a
position, is a very different animal to one qualified
to give laws for the government of the
citizen. After all our vain boasting, that public
sentiment is the law of our land, there is really
a very broad distinction between forming men's
opinions and controlling their action. If the
government had been so organized, that the
pressure of popular feeling might make itself
felt, directly, in the halls of legislation, our
history, instead of being that of a great and ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>vancing
nation, would have been only a chronicle
of factious and unstable violence. It does
not follow, that one who is qualified to lead
voters at the polls, or, as they say here, &ldquo;on
the stump,&rdquo; will be able to embody, in enlightened
enactments, the sentiment which he contributes
to form, any more than that the tanner
will be able to shape a well-fitting boot from the
leather he prepares. &ldquo;<i>Suum cuique proprium
dat Natura donum</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> A blacksmith, therefore,
is not the best manufacturer of silver spoons, a
lawyer the ablest writer of sermons, nor either
of them necessarily the safest law-maker.</p>

<p>But those things to which his qualifications
were appropriate, the politician did thoroughly
and well. For example, he was a skilful farmer&mdash;at
least in the leading branches of that calling,
though he gave little or no attention to the
merely ornamental. For the latter, he had
neither time nor inclination. Even in the essentials,
it was only by working, as he expressed
it, &ldquo;to the best advantage,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, contriving
to produce the largest amount of results with
the least expenditure of labor and patience&mdash;that
he got sufficient leisure to attend to his
public duties; and as for &ldquo;inclination,&rdquo; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
quaker ever felt a more supreme contempt for
mere embellishment.</p>

<br />
<p>He was seldom very happy in his domestic
relations; for, excepting at those seasons when
the exigencies of his calling required his constant
attention, he spent but little of his time at
his own fireside. He absented himself <i>until</i>
his home became strange and uncomfortable to
him: and he then did the same, <i>because</i> it had
become so. Every man who may try the experiment
will discover that these circumstances
mutually aggravate each other&mdash;are, interchangeably,
cause and effect. His children
were, however, always numerous, scarcely ever
falling below half-a-dozen, and not unfrequently
doubling that allowance. They generally appeared
upon the stage in rapid succession&mdash;one
had scarcely time to get out of the way, before
another was pushing him from his place. The
peevishness thus begotten in the mother&mdash;by
the constant habit of nursing cross cherubs&mdash;though
it diminished the amount of family
peace, contributed, in another way, to the
general welfare: it induced the father to look
abroad for enjoyment, and thus gave the country
the benefit of his wisdom as a political counsellor.
Public spirit, and the consciousness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
ability, have &ldquo;brought out&rdquo; many politicians:
but uncomfortable homes have produced many
more.</p>

<br />
<p>He was an oracle on the subject of hunting,
and an unerring judge of whiskey&mdash;to both
which means of enjoyment he was strongly
attached. He was careful, however, neither to
hunt nor drink in solitude, for even his amusements
were subservient to his political interests.
To hunt alone was a waste of time, while drinking
alone was a loss of good-fellowship, upon
which much of his influence was founded. He
was particularly attached to parties of half-a-dozen,
or more; for in such companions, his
talents were always conspicuous. Around a
burgou<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> pot, or along the trenches of an impromptu
barbecue, he shone in meridian splendor;
and the approving smack of his lips, over
a bottle of &ldquo;backwoods' nectar,&rdquo; was the seal
of the judgment which gave character to the
liquor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Militia musters&rdquo; were days in his calendar,
&ldquo;marked with a white-stone;&rdquo; for it was upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
these occasions that he appeared in his utmost
magnificence. His grade was never lower than
that of colonel, and it not unfrequently extended
to, or even beyond, the rank of brigadier-general.
It was worth &ldquo;a sabbath-day's journey&rdquo;
on foot, to witness one of these parades;
for I believe that all the annals of the burlesque
do not furnish a more amusing caricature of the
&ldquo;pomp and circumstance&rdquo; of war. Compared
to one of those militia regiments, Falstaff's
famous corps, whose appearance was so unmilitary
as to prevent even that liberal-minded
gentleman from marching through Coventry in
their company, was a model of elegance and
discipline. Seden&oacute;'s cavalry in the South American
wars, though their uniform consisted only
of &ldquo;leggings,&rdquo; a pair of spurs, and a Spanish
blanket, had more the aspect of a regular <i>corps
d'arm&eacute;e</i> than these! A mob of rustics was
never armed with a more extensive variety of
weapons; and no night's &ldquo;haul&rdquo; of a recruiting
sergeant's net, ever made a more disorderly appearance,
when mustered in the morning for
inspection.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;citizen-soldier&rdquo; knew no more about
&ldquo;dressing the line,&rdquo; than about dressing himself,
and the front of his company presented as
many inequalities as a &ldquo;worm-fence.&rdquo; Tall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
men and short men&mdash;beaver hats and raccoon-skin
caps&mdash;rusty firelocks and long corn-stalks&mdash;stiff
brogans and naked feet&mdash;composed the
grand display. There were as many officers as
men, and each was continually commanding
and instructing his neighbor, but never thinking
of himself. At the command &ldquo;Right dress!&rdquo;
(when the officer <i>par excellence</i> knew enough
to deliver it) some looked right, others left&mdash;some
thrust their heads out before&mdash;some leaned
back to get a glimpse behind&mdash;and the
whole line waved like a streamer in the wind.
&ldquo;Silence in line!&rdquo; produced a greater clamor
than ever, for each repeated the command to
every other, sending the order along the ranks
like a rolling fire, and not unfrequently enforcing
it with the push of a corn-stalk, or a vigorous
elbow-hint. When a movement was directed,
the order reached the men successively, by the
same process of repetition&mdash;so that while some
files were walking slowly, and looking back to
beckon on their lagging fellow-soldiers, others
were forced to a quick run to regain their places,
and the scramble often continued many minutes
after the word &ldquo;halt!&rdquo; The longer the parade
lasted, the worse was the drill; and after a tedious
day's &ldquo;muster,&rdquo; each man knew less, if possible,
of military tactics, than he did in the morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>But the most ludicrous part of the display,
was the earnest solemnity with which the politician-colonel
endeavored &ldquo;to lick the mass into
shape.&rdquo; If you had judged only by the expression
of his face, you would have supposed
that an invading army was already within our
borders, and that this democratic army was the
only hope of patriotism to repel the foreign
foe. And, indeed, it might not be too much to
say, that some such idea actually occupied his
mind: for he was so fond of &ldquo;supposing cases,&rdquo;
that bare possibilities sometimes grew in his
mind to actual realities; and it was a part of
his creed, as well as his policy to preach, that
&ldquo;a nation's best defence&rdquo; is to be found in &ldquo;the
undisciplined valor of its citizens.&rdquo; His military
maxims were not based upon the history
of such countries as Poland and Spain&mdash;and
Hungary had not then added her example to
the list. He never understood the relation between
discipline and efficiency; and the doctrine
of the &ldquo;largest liberty&rdquo; was so popular,
that, on his theory, it must be universally right.
Tempered thus, and modified by some of the
tendencies of the demagogue, his love of military
parade amounted to a propensity, a trait which
he shared with most of the people among whom
he lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>The inference from this characteristic, that
he possessed what phrenologists used to call
&ldquo;combativeness,&rdquo; is not unavoidable, though
such was the fact. He was, indeed, quite pugnacious,
ready, at all times, to fight for himself
or for his friends, and never with any very
special or discriminating reference to the cause
of quarrel. He was, however, seldom at feud
with any one whose enmity could materially
injure him: extensive connections he always
conciliated, and every popular man was his
friend. Nor was he compelled, in order to compass
these ends, to descend to any very low
arts; for &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; were not so fastidious in
those days, as they seem since to have become;
and a straightforward sincerity was then the
first element of popularity. The politician was
not forced to affect an exemplary &ldquo;walk and
conversation;&rdquo; nor was an open declaration of
principle or opinion dangerous to his success.</p>

<p>This liberality in public sentiment had its
evils: since, for example, the politician was not
generally the less esteemed for being rather a
hard <i>swearer</i>. In the majority of the class, indeed,
this amounted only to an energetic or emphatic
mode of expression; and such the people
did not less respect, than if, in the same person,
they had had reason to believe the opposite tone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
hypocritical. The western people&mdash;to their
honor be it written!&mdash;were, and are, mortal
enemies to everything like <i>cant</i>: though they
might regret, that one's morals were no <i>better</i>
than they appeared, they were still more grieved,
if they found evidence, that they were <i>worse</i>
than they claimed to be.</p>

<br />
<p>But, though the politician was really very
open and candid in all the affairs of life, in his
own estimation he was a very dexterous and
dangerous intriguer: he often deceived himself
into the belief, that the success, which was in
fact the result of his manly candor, was attributable
only to his cunning management. He
was always forming, and attempting to execute,
schemes for circumventing his political opponents;
but, if he bore down all opposition, it
was <i>in spite of</i> his chicanery, and not by its
assistance. Left-handed courses are never advantageous
&ldquo;in the long run;&rdquo; and, perhaps, it
would be well if this lesson were better understood
by politicians, even in our own enlightened
day.</p>

<p>For the arts of rhetoric he had small respect;
in his opinion, the man who was capable of
making a long, florid speech, was fit for little
else. His own oratorical efforts were usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
brief, pithy, and to the point. For example,
here follows a specimen, which the writer heard
delivered in Illinois, by a candidate for the
legislature:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens: I am no speech-maker, but
what I say, <i>I'll do</i>. I've lived among you
twenty years, and if I've shown myself a clever
fellow, you know it, <i>without</i> a speech: if I'm
not a clever fellow, you know that, too, and
wouldn't forget it <i>with</i> a speech. I'm a candidate
for the legislature: if you think I'm 'the
clear grit,' <i>vote</i> for me: if you think Major
R&mdash;&mdash; of a better 'stripe' than I am, vote for
<i>him</i>. The fact is, that either of us will make
a devilish good representative!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the satisfaction of the reader, we should
record that the orator was triumphantly elected,
and, though &ldquo;no speech-maker,&rdquo; was an excellent
member for several years.</p>

<br />
<p>The saddest, yet cheerfullest&mdash;the quaintest,
yet most unaffected of moralists, has written
&ldquo;A Complaint upon the Decay of Beggars,&rdquo;
which will not cease to be read, so long as pure
English and pure feeling are understood and
appreciated. They were a part of the recollections
of his childhood&mdash;images painted upon
his heart, impressions made in his soft and pity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>ing
nature; and the &ldquo;besom of societarian reformation,&rdquo;
legislating busybodies, and tinkers
of the general welfare, were sweeping them
away, with all their humanizing influences,
their deep lessons of dire adversity and gentle
charity.</p>

<p>There are some memories of the childhood
of western men&mdash;unlike, and yet similar in their
generous persuasions on all pure young hearts&mdash;upon
whose &ldquo;Decay&rdquo; might, also, be written
a &ldquo;Complaint,&rdquo; which should come as truly,
and yet as sadly, from the heart of him, who
remembers his boyhood, as did that from the
heart of Elia. Gatherings of the militia, burgou-hunts,
barbecues, and anniversaries&mdash;phases
of a primitive, yet true and hearty time!&mdash;are
fast giving way, before the march of a barbarous
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; (erroneously christened) &ldquo;of
intelligence.&rdquo; The hard spirit of money-getting,
the harder spirit of education-getting, and
the hardest of <i>all</i> spirits, that of pharisaical
morality, have divorced our youth, <i>a vinculo</i>,
from every species of amusement; and life has
come to be a probationary struggle, too fierce
to allow a moment's relaxation. The bodies of
children are drugged and worried into health,
their intellects are stuffed and forced into premature
development, or early decay&mdash;but their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
<i>hearts</i> are utterly forgotten! Enjoyment is a forbidden
thing, and only the miserable cant of &ldquo;intellectual
pleasure&rdquo; is allowed. <i>Ideas</i>&mdash;of philosophy,
religious observance, and mathematics&mdash;are
supplied <i>ad nauseam</i>; but the encouragement
of a generous <i>impulse</i>, or a magnanimous
<i>feeling</i>, is too frivolous a thing to have a
place in our vile system. Children are &ldquo;brought
up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brought out,&rdquo; as if they were composed
exclusively of intellect and body: And,
since the manifestations of any other element
are pronounced pernicious&mdash;even if the existence
of the element itself be recognised&mdash;the
means of fostering it, innocent amusements,
which make the sunshine brighter, the spirits
more cheerful, and the heart purer and lighter,
are sternly prohibited. Alas! for the generation
which shall grow up, and be &ldquo;educated&rdquo;
(God save the mark!) as if it had no heart!
And wo to the blasphemy which dares to offer,
as service to Heaven, an arrogant contempt of
Heaven's gifts, and claims a reward, like the
self-tormentors of the middle ages, for its vain
mortifications.</p>

<p>But, in the time of the politician, of whom
we write, these things were far different. We
have already seen him at a &ldquo;militia muster,&rdquo;
and fain would we pause here, to display him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
at a barbecue. What memories, sweet, though
sad, we might evoke of &ldquo;the glorious fourth&rdquo;
in the olden time! How savory are even the
dim recollections of the dripping viands, which
hung, and fried, and crisped, and crackled, over
the great fires, in the long deep trenches! Our
nostrils grow young again with the thought&mdash;and
the flavor of the feast floats on the breezes
of memory, even &ldquo;across the waste of years&rdquo;
which lie between! And the cool, luxuriant
foliage of the grove, the verdant thickets, and
among them pleasant vistas, little patches of
green sward, covered with gay and laughing
parties&mdash;even the rosy-cheeked girls, in their
rustling gingham dresses, cast now and then a
longing glance, toward the yet forbidden tables!
how fresh and clear these images return upon
the fancy!</p>

<p>And then the waving banners, roaring cannon,
and the slow procession, moving all too
solemnly for our impatient wishes! And finally,
the dropping of the ropes, the simultaneous
rush upon the open feast, and the rapid, perhaps
ravenous consumption of the smoking
viands, the jest, the laugh, all pleasant merriment,
the exhilaration of the crowd, the music,
and the occasion! What glories we heard from
the orator, of victories achieved by our fathers!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
How we longed&mdash;O! brief, but glorious dream!
to be one day spoken of like Washington!
How wildly our hearts leaped in our boyish
bosoms, as we listened to the accents of the
solemn pledge and &ldquo;declaration&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;our lives,
our fortunes, and our sacred honor!&rdquo; The
whole year went lighter for that one day, and
at each return, we went home happier, and
better!</p>

<p>How measureless we thought the politician's
greatness then! This was his proper element&mdash;here
he was at home; and, as he ordered and
directed everything about him, flourishing his
marshal's baton, clearing the way for the march
of the procession&mdash;settling the &ldquo;order of exercises,&rdquo;
and reading the programme, in a stentorian
voice&mdash;there was, probably in his own estimation,
and certainly in ours, no more important
or honored individual in all that multitude!</p>

<p>In such scenes as these, he was, indeed, without
a rival; but there were others, also, in
which he was quite as useful, if not so conspicuous.
On election days, for instance, when a
free people assembled to exercise their &ldquo;inestimable
privilege,&rdquo; to choose their own rulers&mdash;he
was as busy as a witch in a tempest. His
talents shone forth with especial and peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
lustre&mdash;for, with him, this was &ldquo;the day for
which all other days were made.&rdquo; He marshalled
his retainers, and led them to &ldquo;the
polls&rdquo;&mdash;not as an inexperienced tactician would
have done, with much waste of time, in seeking
every private voter, but after the manner
of feudal times&mdash;by calling upon his immediate
dependants, captains over tens and twenties,
through whom he managed the more numerous
masses. These were the &ldquo;file-leaders,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;fugle-men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;heads of messes;&rdquo; and it
was by a judicious management of these, that
he was able to acquire and retain an extensive
influence.</p>

<p>The first article of his electioneering creed
was, that every voter was controlled by somebody;
and that the only way to sway the privates
was, to govern the officers: and, whether
true or not, it must be admitted that his theory
worked well in practice. He affected to entertain
a high respect for those whom he described
as &ldquo;the boys from the heads of the hollows&rdquo;&mdash;men
who were never seen beyond the precincts
of their own little &ldquo;clearings,&rdquo; except upon the
Fourth of July and election day, from one end
of the year to the other. With these he drank
bad whiskey, made stale jokes, and affected a
flattering condescension. With others, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
important or less easily imposed upon, he
&ldquo;whittled&rdquo; sociably in the fence-corners, talked
solemnly in conspicuous places, and always
looked confidential and mysterious.</p>

<p>But, however earnestly engaged, he never
forgot the warfare in which he was chief combatant.
Like a general upon a field of battle,
with his staff about him, he had sundry of his
friends always near, to undertake any commission,
or convey any order, which he desired to
have executed; and not a voter could come
upon the ground, whom there was the remotest
chance to influence, that his vigilance did not
at once discover and seize upon, through some
one of these lieutenants. He resorted to every
conceivable art, to induce the freemen to vote
<i>properly</i>; and, when he could not succeed in
this, his next study was to prevent their voting
<i>at all</i>. The consequence usually was, that he
secured his own election, or that of his chosen
candidate; for, in him, vigilance and shrewdness
were happily combined.</p>

<br />
<p>But, perhaps fortunately for the country, his
ambition was generally limited to such small
offices, as he was quite capable of filling. The
highest point at which he aimed, was a seat in
the state legislature; and on reaching that goal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
he signalized his term, chiefly, if at all, in advocating
laws about division fences, and trespassers
upon timber&mdash;measures which he deemed
desirable for his own immediate constituency,
with very little care for the question of their
general utility. Indeed, he never went to the
capital, without having his pockets full of &ldquo;private
bills,&rdquo; for the gratification of his personal
friends, or near neighbors; and if, after a reasonable
term of service, he had succeeded in getting
all these passed into laws, he came home,
contented to &ldquo;subside,&rdquo; and live the remainder
of his days, upon the recollection of his legislative
honors.</p>

<p>In the course of time, like all other earthly
things, his class began to decay. The tide of
immigration, or the increasing intelligence of
the people, raised up men of larger views; and
he speedily found himself outstripped in the
race, and forgotten by his ancient retainers.
Then&mdash;like his predecessor, the original frontierman&mdash;disgusted
with civilization and its
refinements&mdash;he migrated to more congenial
regions, and, in the scenes of his former triumphs,
was heard of no more.</p>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE.</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we must pause.</p>

<p>On the hither side of the period, represented
by the early politician, and between that and
the present, the space of time is much too narrow,
to contain any distinct development: those
who superseded the primitive oracles, are yet
in possession of the temple. We could not,
therefore, pursue our plan further, without
hazarding the charge of drawing from the life.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that anything like a fair or
candid estimate of&mdash;for example&mdash;a public
man's character, while he is yet favored with
the people's suffrages, is very certain to be pronounced
a caricature; and it is not less singular,
that, while the complaints of popular critics,
in effect, affirm that there is fidelity enough in
the picture to enable even obtuse minds to fit
the copy to the original, they at the same time
vehemently assert that the whole portrait is a
libel. A just admeasurement of a demagogue's
ability is thus always abated by the imputation
of partisan falsehood or prejudice; and whosoever
declines to join in the adulation of a temporary
idol, may consider himself fortunate, if
he escape with only the reproach of envy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Sketches of contemporaneous character&mdash;if
they seek recognition among the masses, must,
therefore, not reduce the altitude which blind
admiration has assigned, nor cut away the foreign
lace, nor tear the ornaments, with which
excited parties have bedaubed their images of
clay. And, yet, so prone are men to overrate
their leaders, that no estimate of a prominent
man can be just, without impugning popular
opinion.</p>

<p>There is probably no other ground quite so
perilous as politics, unless it be literature: and,
as yet, the west is comparatively barren of those
&ldquo;sensitive plants,&rdquo; literary men. But any attempt
to delineate society, by portraiture of
living characters, even though the pictures
were purely ideal, would, upon the present plan,
involve the suspicion (and perhaps the temptation
to deserve it), indicated above. Before
venturing upon such uncertain paths, therefore,
we must display a little generalship, and call a
halt, if not a council of war. Whether we are
to march forward, will be determined by the
&ldquo;General <i>Orders</i>.&rdquo;</p>

life, and sketches of society in Ireland during his times, are exceedingly humorous and
interesting.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of those works which are conceived and written in so hearty a view, and
brings before the reader so many palpable and amusing characters, that the entertainment
and information are equally balanced.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<h4><i>JOMINI'S CAMPAIGN OF WATERLOO.</i></h4>

<p>The Political and Military History of the Campaign of Waterloo,
from the French of Gen. Baron Jomini, by Lieut. <span class="smcap">S. V. Benet</span>,
U. S. Ordnance, with a Map, 12mo, cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Of great value, both for its historical merit and its acknowledged impartiality.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian
Freeman, Boston.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has long been regarded in Europe as a work of more than ordinary merit, while
to military men his review of the tactics and man&#339;uvres of the French Emperor during
the few days which preceded his final and most disastrous defeat, is considered as
instructive, as it is interesting.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Arthur's Home Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a standard authority and illustrates a subject of permanent interest. With
military students, and historical inquirers, it will be a favorite reference, and for the
general reader it possesses great value and interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It throws much light on often mooted points respecting Napoleon's military and
political genius. The translation is one of much vigor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Commonwealth.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It supplies an important chapter in the most interesting and eventful period of Napoleon's
military career.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Savannah Daily News.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is ably written and skilfully translated.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Yankee Blade.</i></p></div>


<h4><i>NOTES AND EMENDATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE.</i></h4>

<p>Notes and Emendations to the Text of Shakespeare's Plays, from
the Early Manuscript Corrections in a copy of the folio of 1632,
in the possession of <span class="smcap">John Payne Collier</span>, Esq., F.S.A. Third
edition, with a facsimile of the Manuscript Corrections. 1 vol.
12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is not for a moment to be doubted, we think, that in this volume a contribution
has been made to the clearness and accuracy of Shakespeare's text, by far the most important
of any offered or attempted since Shakespeare lived and wrote.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lond. Exam.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The corrections which Mr. Collier has here given to the world are, we venture to
think, of more value than the labors of nearly all the critics on Shakespeare's text put
together.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a rare gem in the history of literature, and can not fail to command the attention
of all the amateurs of the writings of the immortal dramatic poet.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ch'ston Cour.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a book absolutely indispensable to every admirer of Shakespeare who wishes
to read him understandingly.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Louisville Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear from internal evidence, that for the most part they are genuine restorations
of the original plays. They carry conviction with them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This volume is an almost indispensable companion to any of the editions of
Shakespeare, so numerous and often important are many of the corrections.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Register,
Philadelphia.</i></p></div>

<h4><i>THE HISTORY OF THE CRUSADES.</i></h4>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Joseph Fran&ccedil;ois Michaud</span>. Translated by W. Robson, 3 vols.
12mo., maps, $3.75.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is comprehensive and accurate in the detail of facts, methodical and lucid in arrangement,
with a lively and flowing narrative.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Journal of Commerce.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We need not say that the work of Michaud has superseded all other histories
of the Crusades. This history has long been the standard work with all who could
read it in its original language. Another work on the same subject is as improbable
as a new history of the 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.'&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Salem Freeman.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The most faithful and masterly history ever written of the wild wars for the Holy
Land.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia American Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The ability, diligence, and faithfulness, with which Michaud has executed his
great task, are undisputed; and it is to his well-filled volumes that the historical student
must now resort for copious and authentic facts, and luminous views respecting
this most romantic and wonderful period in the annals of the Old World.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Daily Courier.</i></p></div>

of the &ldquo;Cavaliers of England,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c. Fourteenth Edition.
Revised and Corrected.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;This is one of the best works of the kind we have ever read&mdash;full of thrilling incidents
and adventures in the stirring times of Cromwell, and in that style which has
made the works of Mr. Herbert so popular.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Freeman, Boston.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The work is distinguished by the same historical knowledge, thrilling incident, and
pictorial beauty of style, which have characterized all Mr. Herbert's fictions and imparted
to them such a bewitching interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Yankee Blade.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The author out of a simple plot and very few characters, has constructed a novel
of deep interest and of considerable historical value. It will be found well worth
reading.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>National &AElig;gis, Worcester.</i></p></div>

<h4><b>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</b></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The author of 'Lorenzo Benoni' is <span class="smcap">Giovanni Ruffini</span>, a native of Genoa, who effected
his escape from his native country after the attempt at revolution in 1833. His book is,
in substance, an authentic account of real persons and incidents, though the writer has
chosen to adopt fictitious and fantastic designations for himself and his associates. Since
1833, Ruffini has resided chiefly (if not wholly) in England and France, where his qualities,
we understand, have secured him respect and regard. In 1848, he was selected by
Charles Albert to fill the responsible situation of embassador to Paris, in which city he
had long been domesticated as a refugee. He ere long, however, relinquished that office,
and again withdrew into private life. He appears to have employed the time of his exile
in this country to such advantage as to have acquired a most uncommon mastery over
the English language. The present volume (we are informed on good authority) is exclusively
his own&mdash;and, if so, on the score of style alone it is a remarkable curiosity.
But its matter also is curious.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Quarterly Review for July.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A tale of sorrow that has lain long in a rich mind, like a ruin in a fertile country, and
is not the less gravely impressive for the grace and beauty of its coverings ... at the
same time the most determined novel-reader could desire no work more fascinating over
which to forget the flight of time.... No sketch of foreign oppression has ever, we believe,
been submitted to the English public by a foreigner, equal or nearly equal to this
volume in literary merit. It is not unworthy to be ranked among contemporary works
whose season is the century in which their authors live.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Examiner.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book should be as extensively read as 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' inasmuch as it
develops the existence of a state of slavery and degradation, worse even than that which
Mrs. Beecher Stowe has elucidated with so much pathos and feeling.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bell's Weekly
Messenger.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Few works of the season will be read with greater pleasure than this; there is a
great charm in the quiet, natural way in which the story is told.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Atlas.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The author's great forte is character-painting. This portraiture is accomplished
with remarkable skill, the traits both individual and national being marked with great
nicety without obtrusiveness.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the modest guise of the biography of an imaginary 'Lorenzo Benoni,' we have
here, in fact, the memoir of a man whose name could not be pronounced in certain parts
of northern Italy without calling up tragic yet noble historical recollections.... Its
merits, simply as a work of literary art, are of a very high order. The style is really
beautiful&mdash;easy, sprightly, graceful, and full of the happiest and most ingenious turns of
phrase and fancy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>North British Review.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This has been not unjustly compared to '<i>Gil Blas</i>,' to which it is scarcely inferior in
spirited delineations of human character, and in the variety of events which it relates.
But as a description of actual occurrences illustrating the domestic and political condition
of Italy, at a period fraught with interest to all classes of readers, it far transcends
in importance any work of mere fiction.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Mail.</i></p></div>

and no lover or student of Shakespeare should be without it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Argus.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Altogether the most correct and therefore the most valuable edition extant.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany
Express.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This edition of Shakespeare will ultimately supersede all others. It must certainly
be deemed an essential acquisition by every lover of the great dramatist.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This great work commends itself in the highest terms to every Shakespearian scholar

<p>&ldquo;It is clear from internal evidence that they are genuine restorations of the original
plays.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Detroit Daily Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This must we think supersede all other editions of Shakespeare hitherto published.
Collier's corrections make it really a different work from its predecessors. Compared
with it we consider them hardly worth possessing.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Georgian, Savannah.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;One who will probably hereafter be considered as the only true authority. No one
we think, will wish to purchase an edition of Shakespeare, except it shall be conformable
to the amended text by Collier.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Newark Daily Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A great outcry has been made in England against this edition of the bard, by Singer
and others interested in other editions; but the emendations commend themselves
too strongly to the good sense of every reader to be dropped by the public&mdash;the old
editions must become obsolete.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Yankee Blade, Boston.</i></p></div>
